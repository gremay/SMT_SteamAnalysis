0;For The Warp;good game i feel the graphics vibe of into the breach game and the grid map remind me of super robot wars srw series the dev offer a bit different rules of the card game without discarded game but always randomly spawn card from the deck but hey thats the challenge  suggestion from me as the game is still alpha need more interactive and interesting event  i dont regret to bought this and still wait for the great development from the dev;10.9;1.0;0.0;127.0;12 September, 2021;True;441
1;For The Warp;brilliant little game had so much fun with it already keep up to good work guys excited for the full release;6.1;1.0;0.0;117.0;19 July, 2021;True;109
2;For The Warp;solid deck building space exploration/combat and awesome story;7.7;1.0;0.0;42.0;22 January, 2021;True;63
3;For The Warp;often absolutely dependent on luck in the first turn without any reshuffle options especially encounters with multiple units not having shield cards usually means game over most of the battles are about getting enough shield points and stopping the occasional powerful attacks;14.3;1.0;0.0;212.0;05 April, 2020;True;277
4;For The Warp;a nice game which lacks some polish at the moment you have too little control over the gameplay as the few possible combos depend on getting the required cards by luck the replay factor needs improvement too as you can only unlock 34 ship hulls but no powerfull cards or something similiar for the next round currently there are only a few 5 levels/star systems which make the game very short nevertheless i enjoyed it and hope for a dlc and the needed improvements;5.7;1.0;0.0;1289.0;23 August, 2020;True;466

10;For The Warp;this game reminds me of the good times i had in slay the spire if you like deckbuilding this is a great game for you spire was the first game that got me into deckbuilding but it felt too rigid and linear this one gives a lot more path choices and as far as strats/builds go it feels more flexible;8.7;1.0;0.0;144.0;31 March, 2022;False;297

17;For The Warp;game is nice concept but feels like aplha becuse it is aplha  cards need to be balanced and mechanic making the game more dificult should be put in the combat interface in quite unredable its hard to understand what debuff i have and things like that it is a promising alpha;0.9;1.0;1.0;82.0;29 March, 2020;True;275

25;For The Warp;this game is super fun if you like strategy and puzzle deck based games this game is all about the risk vs reward sometimes you get in a situation where you have zero chance of winning but it is still early in development and its part of the fun;26.1;1.0;2.0;4.0;23 December, 2020;True;246

28;For The Warp;this game is way more fun than it has any right to be;58.0;1.0;0.0;20.0;14 May, 2021;True;54
30;For The Warp;very much like slay the spire but i think that i prefer the aesthetic a little bit more because the sound track is amazing and all of the ships are very well drawn and animated slay the spire still has more content but the content that is here is very promising i am excited to see what else the developers plan to add;8.4;1.0;0.0;283.0;02 April, 2020;True;319
31;For The Warp;solid turn-based game if you liked ftl and you like games with deck based combat like gloom haven this is for you i like the music and the sound and not being followed by the big orange space fleet of ftl explore kill loot buy;19.4;1.0;0.0;530.0;11 January, 2021;True;227

33;For The Warp;worth a short play overall i would say this game has a lot of potential and the style is there it needs a good bit of cleaning and a lot of encounter/non-combat content i hope this sale gets it the attention it needs i look forward to playing this some time down the road;7.0;1.0;0.0;294.0;13 August, 2020;True;272
34;For The Warp;the game is pretty well done on the deck building i also like how there is no discard pile mechanic to the game game play itself is literally challenging depending on your card draws and deck build the game does a good job on making me think if i should add more cards to the deck or stay with a small deck i really wish the devs would have some type of controller support to the game though all in all the game is fluid and really solid im looking forward to the future updates to this game;10.9;1.0;0.0;123.0;11 January, 2021;True;492

37;For The Warp;this has a lot of potential i like the style and art a lot the gameplay is ftl meets slay the spire or any other deckbuilder basically its fun so far but definitely needs balancing and a lot of work as its early access im hopeful itll be a great game im glad i picked it up;0.6;1.0;0.0;1886.0;05 May, 2021;True;274
39;For The Warp;i enjoy it however needs some more work i think i especially enjoyed the carrier ship and the drones was pretty fun;1.0;1.0;0.0;104.0;02 April, 2022;False;115
40;For The Warp;2020 product received for free  early access review refreshing to see another pixel sci-fi game rouge like elements are a lot of fun and i was really into it made for a good stream   surprisingly complex and a lot of replayability;3.1;1.0;1.0;873.0;07 April, 2020;False;230
41;For The Warp;a pretty nice slay the spire alike but in space i see it has sectors based exploration which is similar to the ftl exploration as well so far i enjoyed the game might make a few vids on it as well;19.5;1.0;1.0;148.0;01 April, 2020;True;197
43;For The Warp;if you like card games that throws balance out of the equation because its single player this games got it all abuse the game mechanics make tiny decks make one turn kill decks make first turn kill deck make combos that ramp damage to 4 digits no run is the same and they hardly ever turn out the way you want fun times cant wait to see more content;56.7;1.0;1.0;68.0;05 July, 2021;True;350
45;For The Warp;good game looks sounds and plays great  theres a lot of variety to the cards with plenty of synergies for a player capitalise on when you play some battle-winning combo youll feel like a genius  im looking forward to seeing how the game grows during early access;7.6;1.0;0.0;979.0;28 March, 2020;True;263
46;For The Warp;rogue-like deckbuilder in spaaaaaaaaaaaaace its amazing my only concern its that theres this weird feature that makes you play the game for 6 hours non-stop as soon as you install it dont know if they should patch it but my eyes hurt;17.3;1.0;0.0;275.0;15 January, 2021;True;234
47;For The Warp;up and coming pixel art gem of a game great stff;46.6;1.0;0.0;489.0;04 February, 2021;True;49
48;For The Warp;not as good as some of the card rougelights out there but still not terrible  has a lot of annoying little bugs though cards not doing what they say no display for your ship about status effects  the deck building also needs another balance pass some cards are just not any good;12.0;1.0;0.0;519.0;27 April, 2022;False;278
49;For The Warp;fun for a few hours seems poorly balanced i beat the game on my second try by using an infinite healing infinite money infinite stun all enemies loop;6.1;1.0;0.0;653.0;05 April, 2020;True;150
52;For The Warp;game is okay a little too easy for my liking for the average roguelike card builder wish it was harder made it through on first clear on first attempt;2.0;1.0;0.0;127.0;28 August, 2021;True;151
53;For The Warp;game is clearly in super early access but it is fun the design art and music are all good just need more of everything keep up the good work team and this will be a solid keeper;11.2;1.0;0.0;112.0;19 January, 2021;True;178

59;For The Warp;a great start to a nice little deck-builder it has quite a few combos that work well and a few ships you can play as with different capabilities i do wish there were more to the game and i also wish the game loaded faster than it does;96.3;1.0;0.0;332.0;22 November, 2021;True;235

64;For The Warp;i dont like rouge-like/lites am digging this game;4.6;1.0;0.0;728.0;05 December, 2020;True;50
65;For The Warp;a very interesting game that is still in its development stage it is already playable nice pixel graphics and music give it a try especially if you like games like slay the spire ftl etc you won`t regret it the developer is regularly listening to the feedback i highly recommend this hidden gem;16.2;1.0;2.0;16450.0;19 April, 2020;True;295
67;For The Warp;this game is extremely fun even for me someone who is new to this genre the cards in this game are pretty broken so its really fun just to destroy your enemies most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive my only issue is the last ships deck being drones and shields while i understand its suppose to be a defensive play style it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card i would probably buff the shield cards but its not a big deal overall a fun game with crucial decision making wits and rng;15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;22 April, 2020;True;564
68;For The Warp;love the draft mode in this game have had some amazing combinations of cards that were entertaining to play definitely recommend if you like card-based roguelikes looking forward to seeing what they add;6.2;1.0;0.0;495.0;21 August, 2021;True;203
69;For The Warp;solid game if you think you might be into it just go ahead and pick it up really soaks up some time took me about 10 hours till i got a playthru to beat the game multiple different ships with different playstyles to keep it interesting;14.5;1.0;0.0;163.0;04 September, 2021;True;236
71;For The Warp;this game is super super promising but there are a couple of run-killing issues with it the main one being that there sometimes isnt an end to the game you can build a deck that makes all the enemies in the final zone completely trivial and then you cant actually leave that zone because for whatever reason the warp gate is gone  once they fix this and add a little more variety to the encounters and i do only mean a little it will be up there with legends of the genre like ftl;10.6;1.0;0.0;79.0;03 January, 2021;True;481
72;For The Warp;eh its good but it isnt there yet for me;1.6;1.0;0.0;197.0;15 July, 2020;True;41
73;For The Warp;a fun game mixing slay the spire fight and into the breach map mechanics in space with great potential what do you want more a bit more variety to enemies could help maybe a bit more to the story maybe greater difference between the ships to choose from though nonetheless one of the greater early access rough-like titles out there right now which already brought my about 7 hours of very nice gaming experience so far i am curious about what else will come down the development roadmap;9.1;1.0;0.0;153.0;24 May, 2021;True;488
74;For The Warp;ftl meets hearthstone  gorgeous pixel art great music good sci-fi fun game  still early days but this shows a lot of promise the menus and interactions can use some love but the core of the game is strong and has a great foundation to grow  already getting that one more turn crave every time im on a roll and am obliterated  *update*  over 10 hours in and the game keeps getting better the new ships systems and cards change things up significantly;13.1;1.0;6.0;336.0;27 March, 2020;True;450
75;For The Warp;take one part ftl faster than light and mix in a healthy helping of slay the spire then add just a tiny pinch of halcyon 5s graphical style and you get this roguelike deckbuilder card combat game set in space while some of the strategies in the game appear to be more or less valid than others theres enough there to make the time spent worth it overall the gameplay feels both familiar and fresh at the same time  ive played it for 25 hours in one sitting and i am sure ill come back to it more in the future;29.8;1.0;0.0;1159.0;28 November, 2021;True;510
76;For The Warp;played only the 1st map but i am hooked already;2.6;1.0;0.0;476.0;15 July, 2021;True;48
77;For The Warp;ive been having a lot of fun with ftw theres definite stylistic comparisons that can be drawn between ftw and ftl with influence from slay the spire but its a standalone game given that its a rogue-like-like it can have some randomness problems but is overall pretty well balanced there isnt much of a story at this time but as of this writing alpha 061 its very early in its development looking forward to a much greater variety of content including encounters enemies and music looking forward to continued growth and evolution check it out;15.9;1.0;2.0;1207.0;07 April, 2020;True;543
78;For The Warp;early access review fine game needs more enemy types;8.3;1.0;1.0;391.0;09 January, 2022;False;52
81;For The Warp;if you like slay the spire i think youll like this game as well;23.8;1.0;1.0;79.0;11 September, 2020;True;64
82;For The Warp;addictive fun and simple one of the best most intuitive deck builders ive played id kill for a deck builder;13.4;1.0;0.0;321.0;18 October, 2021;True;108
83;For The Warp;like the little brother of slay the spire and ftl if you like one of these you will also like this the pixel art is nice the hard combos are fun and the gameplay is very fluid with clear ui and nice feedback the game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature sometimes the runs are hard sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo both are rewarding right now the content is still less than ftl and sts but both these game are unusual for the replayability i easily played 10h more than shown here one steam and still will play more great game overall;41.7;1.0;1.0;392.0;06 May, 2021;True;566
84;For The Warp;great fun space card game;5.0;1.0;0.0;146.0;09 March, 2021;True;26

89;For The Warp;not bad at all a few _very_ minor issues here and there sound volume bugs less than stellar clickmapping etc but hopefully they stick with the development and it continues to improve;20.7;1.0;0.0;617.0;10 April, 2021;True;183

91;For The Warp;fun little alpha game basically ftl meets slay the spire with great pixel graphics still not bored after a few runs looking forward to watching it grow;9.6;1.0;1.0;181.0;17 April, 2020;True;152
92;For The Warp;i really think theres something here that could become a lot more than a simple deck builder with how the art style and soundtrack gripped me instantly looking forward to see where this goes theres a lot of potential if the gameplay gets some real depth some ftl-style random encounters would do wonders for this game as well;36.3;1.0;0.0;94.0;05 April, 2020;True;326
93;For The Warp;yes i am not normally a deck builder fan but this one wins my only real grip is there are only three ships to play as as far as i know okay now there are more ships and some of the new additions to the card types are really fun although i still think prime defence and syphon drone are essential early game;91.8;1.0;0.0;318.0;16 May, 2020;True;307
95;For The Warp;my first experience with a roguelike deckbuilder i only decided to purchase it because of the great pixel art and space theme as well as the fact that i needed a new passtime after 2 hours in i can honestly say that this will definitely be game i can play when i need a break i cant wait until the full game comes out;186.0;1.0;0.0;61.0;11 June, 2020;True;318

105;For The Warp;this has easily become one of my favorite games of all time if you like ftl and the card game dominion then i highly recommend it even in early access it is really good there are a few mistakes/bugs that ive noticed but they dont affect the game play too much sometimes the damage value calculations or other things seem to be off but it usually is in favor of the user ive only played on normal mode so far but everything seems balanced and enjoyably random my only big critiques is that its too addicting to put down halfway through which can be a problem since it takes awhile to finish a game;188.5;1.0;0.0;78.0;03 January, 2021;True;597
106;For The Warp;still an early access title but already fun;36.2;1.0;0.0;336.0;08 July, 2020;True;44
107;For The Warp;a bit buggy and perhaps a little unbalanced at the time you can win if you spend a bunch of time doing fights rather than rushing the exit but pretty fun overall;52.2;1.0;0.0;71.0;16 July, 2020;True;162
110;For The Warp;its real fun decks build too big if u let it so u gotta skip a lotta card rewards be nice if u could sell cards more but im looking forward to more patches audio and visual lag every now and then and get distorted  but im sure they wil figure it out;9.8;1.0;0.0;74.0;29 March, 2020;True;250

113;For The Warp;early access review enjoyable and a lot of potential but sadly lacking content finished in about 3 hours including hardcore game was released two years ago and is still early access expected more;6.5;1.0;0.0;145.0;16 January, 2022;False;195
114;For The Warp;so far so good a good rougelike with lots of different styles of play the next big step would be hide the location of the next waygate giving a longer stint on the map;7.6;1.0;0.0;371.0;15 August, 2021;True;168
115;For The Warp;this game is good as is and has potential to be even better  mechanics are very similar to slay the spire theme is pretty great and looks like the story might have some heavy background as they continue working on it  if you are willing to take a gamble or just really like the concept it is probably worth getting even if it isnt on sale;5.4;1.0;0.0;227.0;30 June, 2021;True;339
117;For The Warp;very promising early-access game and very playable in its current state if you liked ftl and slay the spire youll like this and if you didnt like one or either of them you probably wont i loved both games so im excited to see how this develops;2.7;1.0;0.0;228.0;29 December, 2020;True;244
118;For The Warp;cool game so far needs a lot more content but its in alpha ive got 5 hours in and all ships except the hidden one are unlocked and ive beat the game several times already have all the cards memorized this could be really awesome but it really needs a lot more content to get there already bored with it will check back when they update it;6.6;1.0;0.0;284.0;19 January, 2021;True;339

123;For The Warp;ever played slay the spire but felt it needed more spaceships  say no more for the warp has you covered this deckbuilding game takes everything you love and potentially hate about these card game rpgs and blasts it right into space you explore systems have some friendly and not so friendly encounters wholl all throw cards your way faster than you can jump to warp speed;4.6;1.0;21.0;420.0;28 March, 2020;True;372

127;For The Warp;its not bad its a bit rng heavy and bit light on content but it isnt overly expensive the pixel art and general gameplay mechanics are good a bit of fleshing out and variety in both fights and encounters would help along with a bit less of the aforementioned rng the fuel mechanic is kind of whatever if you have a good deck;9.9;1.0;0.0;262.0;01 April, 2022;False;324
128;For The Warp;this game is fun as long as it is in alpha that means more content as long as devs dont mess it up this one will just keep growing also im a big fan of crying suns  edit been a couple months no news hoping its not dead has some bugs its looking like abandonware still fun but looks to join the ranks of games forgotten;46.3;1.0;0.0;272.0;29 April, 2020;True;319

134;For The Warp;really fun deck building game the style and music of this game is really great kinda wish you didnt lose your deck when you die but i see why it is that way since you could get lucky and build a pretty op deck but other than that im excited about what they are going to add once this game gets out of early access;99.0;1.0;0.0;81.0;30 March, 2020;True;314

138;For The Warp;while i much prefer slay the spire to this game it is still very good so far  due to the fact there is no discard pile the game feels a lot more random until you get your deck sorted out you cant really predict what cards youre going to get unless you cycle through your entire deck which is possible based on what ive seen;5.4;1.0;0.0;207.0;27 January, 2021;True;324
139;For The Warp;solid game that scratched my itch for a space battle / deck-building / roguelike mashup this game reminds me a lot of ftl -- but i like what it is a lot better than ftl gone is the hassle of micromanagement and the pixel art is good i look forward to the future of this game;15.6;1.0;0.0;323.0;14 August, 2020;True;275
140;For The Warp;short but sweet little space deckbuilder i fail to see the rouglelike/lite aspect as different ships unlock when you defeat stage bosses but thats really not a concern  there is virtually no story here so those wanting an in-depth or even light story as you crush your enemies wont find one here this has more potential and i hope that the developer does seek out more recommendations before official launch  10/10 would answer the proximity detector alert again;4.7;1.0;0.0;81.0;27 December, 2020;True;463

160;For The Warp;the game is a very fun roguelike space exploration deckbuilding card-fighter think ftl meets slay the spire  i have noticed it tends to lag during combat but its an alpha so i suppose its to be expected i hope it gets fixed soon though  also having some animations when a card is played discarded etc would be nice;8.6;1.0;10.0;177.0;27 March, 2020;True;315
161;For The Warp;a genuine gem of a game that contends with its likenesses of ftl and slay the spire it needs optimization and for the love of god drones need to fire before the enemys turn but i genuinely havent had this much fun in ages great title;17.4;1.0;0.0;239.0;29 July, 2020;True;234

176;For The Warp;like other negative reviews power scaling is strange and basic survival past the first round or two seems to be based on luck if you get shield capacity and energy the battles are long and enemies are mostly uninteresting you just slug away at each other taking turns recharging shields and taking shots for the price i think there are many other better deck builders but its not awful the art and theme are very well done;10.5;0.0;7.0;441.0;06 April, 2022;False;422
177;For The Warp;disappointing some builds of the game i couldnt even play because of technical issues aspect ratio/screen region problems couldnt detect inputs etc but beyond that the game design has very large flaws there is no disincentive for going to every single square and fighting every single enemy which makes the entire experience involve no meaningful decision making and having it be extremely tedious and boring there are large balance issues with certain cards being much too efficient and easy to consistently draw due to deck size pass;2.9;0.0;1.0;85.0;29 June, 2021;True;536
178;For The Warp;this game is a -huge- slog  enemies have so much hp and the gameplay is so incredibly dull and unengaging that i could never recommend this to someone;4.2;0.0;6.0;1042.0;03 April, 2022;False;150

184;For The Warp;ftw doesnt have much of a story if any story it is lacking in ways to make the playable ships different all ships draw from the same card pool  the boss fights are just a big bag of health points even the final fight is no different to all the fights that came before  with a name like ftw it is going to be compared to ftl and ftl is better in every way ftw could have learnt a lot from them especially about story;18.6;0.0;12.0;465.0;06 April, 2022;False;415

187;For The Warp;the game is ok but the total randomness of the cards really detracts starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships if you encounter multiple 3 ship groups in a row you just plain lose the damage output balance is very weak it feels like a beta game drafting is cool but way over powered compared to the base decks;63.2;0.0;5.0;70.0;06 April, 2022;False;364
188;For The Warp;like other reviews have said the draw mechanic is nonsensical you dont draw a card from the top you draw it from a pool so you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them  finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire got nothing for it hardcore didnt even unlock game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others art is pretty nice the theme is good ran into several bugs  play monster train instead;1.7;0.0;30.0;490.0;05 August, 2020;True;484

191;For The Warp;early access review kinda fun but way to meany bugs on my first run for some reason my ship did not take any damage from attack leading to an easy not fun win on my 2nd run game would 3 times when leaving events/combat the game got sort of soft locked were i had to quit to main menu and continue run to to keep playing not game breaking but very annoying;11.1;0.0;0.0;67.0;05 February, 2022;False;355
194;For The Warp;fun little game for 4 hours worth a play on offer  completed it within that time though and after that there isnt much to make me want to play more  it doesnt have the re-playablity allure that ftl had for different runs / decks and unlocks;3.8;0.0;9.0;491.0;16 July, 2021;True;241
195;For The Warp;product received for free  it really doesnt stand out at all its just another one of those deck builder games it doesnt have much in the way of charm or originality;0.7;0.0;1.0;950.0;12 May, 2022;False;164
196;For The Warp;really nice on the surface concept artstyle musicthe first few runs are really fun  i really wish i could give a reccomendation but its very unbalanced and repetitve either you get the right aka broken combinations of cards/upgrades at the beginning easy win or you dont then its almost a guaranteed loss  also some qol improvements would be really nice clear indicators for active powerups or status effects support for 219 resolutions etc  changes from the early access version are almost not noticable except the new cards would love to love it but cant as it is right now;17.1;0.0;5.0;111.0;02 April, 2022;False;575
201;For The Warp;this still feels like its in early access and could use some work before its set at the moment the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions most of the cards you get also just dont see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - theyre just small numbers boosts a lot of the time the idea has potential overall and its possible a future version will make notable improvements but its currently hard to recommend over the other deck-builder games available on steam;2.5;0.0;5.0;919.0;09 February, 2021;True;511

207;For The Warp;unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this i like the premise having some elements of ftl but its extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile if they changed this i could see the game being a lot better but its restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity in my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies its a refund for now but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care;0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;25 April, 2021;True;576

211;For The Warp;misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable there are also a lot of poor design decisions like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible stack as much shield as possible every turn then spend remaining energy on attack cards with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing;7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;12 April, 2022;False;498
213;For The Warp;the game-play is pretty boring for now 5 hours to kill all bosses with second ship on normal mode and 90% of the time there were repetitive boring fights i expected more variety;5.9;0.0;3.0;104.0;29 March, 2022;False;177

218;For The Warp;2 hours were quite enough to give it few runs to see all the meat its a nice concept but many aspects of it still requires quite much polish more like no than yes wish there was a neutral option on steam for review system;1.5;0.0;2.0;581.0;26 January, 2021;True;222
220;For The Warp;its an intriguing entry in the card-battle genre but i was disappointed to beat it on the first try i had a card that gave shields and hp for just 1 energy and doesnt get removed from your deck so i was basically invulnerable  in general it doesnt feel like much effort has been spent on card balance id recommend getting slay the spire monster train or griftlands instead;2.8;0.0;2.0;349.0;12 May, 2021;True;373
221;For The Warp;this needs a good deal of work it has a lot of promise but being so close to release and still so buggy and looking so fuzzy/hazy at times this feels like a mobile game that is getting tested first through steam and feels like it at times the aesthetic is nice but even slay the spire has better/smoother animations also doesnt bug out as much and lose you cards/money/etc ill have to check it out again after release to see if it fixed itself or is mostly aesthetic knockoff of a mobile-but-only-pc slay the spire;0.9;0.0;1.0;136.0;19 April, 2021;True;515
222;For The Warp;problems with the game so far 1 the basic ship balance is not there nothing comes even close to the secret ship 2 no upgrades to cards and no balance either 3 too short for a release version 4 bugs out should be in beta;22.1;0.0;2.0;202.0;02 April, 2022;False;219

2170;Subnautica: Below Zero;this game was pretty cool gave me chills had a great time with this game however if you want a more scary underwater experience like the first game this is a severe downgrade i never had the same sense of fear that was present in the first game its also a lot shorter despite there being more objectives the weird thing is that i still prefer this game over the original but i can understand if some were disappointed with the game but i still highly recommend this game for its great game play scenery and penglings;34.1;1.0;0.0;44.0;19 May, 2022;False;516

2172;Subnautica: Below Zero;definitely not as good as the first one half of the map is on land but the movement physics and creature mechanics there are lackluster and often annoying since half of the map is on land it means theres less content in sea they shouldve focused all of their efforts on the underwater part because the underwater biomes are not as good compared to the ones in first game and often look murky barren and boring despite all of this its still a subnautica game and you will get your fair share of clutch moments with local fauna the tapeworm infested crystal caves were actually pretty amusing;22.1;1.0;0.0;254.0;22 May, 2022;False;590

2268;Subnautica: Below Zero;fun game mechanics much better than the first game still some annoying bugs though the map in my opinion isnt as good as the first game mainly just because its very confusing and like a maze in a lot of places storyline is hella good and a lot of fun with the new characters introduced;45.8;1.0;0.0;14.0;21 May, 2022;False;285
2269;Subnautica: Below Zero;truly an excellent game beautiful and oh so fun to play superb follow-up to the first game kept everything i loved added so many new elements to keep it interesting if youre anything like me after finishing the first subnautica you booted the game up again to play it through having a good time but a little sad you cant experience the mystery anew below zero gives you that exact feeling of coming home to a game you love with a fresh story now with sea monkeys;48.6;1.0;0.0;104.0;18 May, 2022;False;462

2279;Subnautica: Below Zero;if you liked the core game play elements of the original subnautica you will likely enjoy this addition the game play loop of explore gather upgrade build repeat is much of the same with some new tweaks and as mentioned earlier if you liked this from the 1st this will scratch that itch  the story is a little weaker not bad but some story element from the 1st game and glossed over or ignored in this story while the 1st game felt very wrapped up when completed this one had some lose ends that were never addressed i still would recommend the game despite of this;29.5;1.0;0.0;300.0;21 May, 2022;False;565
2280;Subnautica: Below Zero;i am a big fan of both subnautica games and this one didnt let me down this game feels more stream lined and a better fleshed out story than the previous subnautica i found myself finding all the blueprints i needed as i progressed below zero when the original left you searching for those much needed parts which could be frustrating i would have liked to see more verticality in below zero unlike the first subnautica i never felt like i was falling deeper and deeper into the unknown depths;55.9;1.0;0.0;6.0;18 May, 2022;False;493

2351;Subnautica: Below Zero;downplayed everything that made the first one good you know what a game about diving alone needs land exploration talking protagonist with an agenda characters and dialog it feels like $10 expansion for the original and if treated as such it is not a bad game has interesting ideas but cons outweigh the pros looks and plays like subnautica but in a tiny map relaying on confusing layouts of caves / land and vision obscuring weather sale fodder not worth the full price;26.1;0.0;4.0;614.0;18 May, 2022;False;470

2374;Subnautica: Below Zero;the dude in the trailer is the only character i really like buy this game on a sale of 25% or more it was meant to be a dlc initially - and it should be sadly  good game for other audiences 9 year olds with thalassophobia and needing a human voice around constantly not so much for us veterans of the series hope number 3 is better  ps there is no in between rating add one pls steam;3.8;0.0;1.0;8.0;20 May, 2022;False;383

2475;We Were Here Forever;the best one in the series but there were some puzzles in this game that i was really just not a fan of the difficulty in the puzzles varied a lot and one of them literally made no sense at all and we just had to brute force the solution until we got through it we could not even reverse engineer the solution once we had the answers thats how bad that one was maybe we were just dumb  you should probably play the other three before you play this one tho;8.8;1.0;0.0;293.0;22 May, 2022;False;455

2893;Songs of Conquest;early access review a very nice turn-based strategy game quite similar format to a well-known heroes of might and magic homm for those who are familiar with the franchise but also approach the genre with a different way which is very news and make the game exciting in its own  the developers went with the idea of using less common fantasy as their own component of the game instead of a more common elf and dwarf you get fays and frogmen very nice to see more fantasy stuff that is not already everywhere in the market  and it comes with good old tavern style song;54.9;1.0;0.0;155.0;20 May, 2022;False;566
2894;Songs of Conquest;early access review i would recommend it but it is a bit overpriced for the content it has if you like heroes of might & magic you will like this too overall its pretty good but needs some time to balance out the mechanics mainly magic and the massive snowball problem for experienced players the ai is way to easy with only 2 difficult options had some minor issues with bugs one which requires a reload of a match but nothing major;27.7;1.0;1.0;1006.0;17 May, 2022;False;433
2895;Songs of Conquest;early access review great game at first blush very similar to old heroes of might and magic with a couple of interesting changes  the magic system is really flexible and interesting but im not sure if its balanced which isnt a big deal for me the way to invest in it includes both your hero and your army which is interesting  the unit cap makes this more strategic and interesting and you wont necesserily want to build everything every game which is also cool;8.7;1.0;1.0;444.0;20 May, 2022;False;461

2898;Songs of Conquest;early access review i am about to finish up the first campaign and i have really been enjoying the gameplay there is room for improvement but those are all low hanging fruit what lavapotion has done was create a beautiful strategy game that reminds me of some classics from the 90s and then updated for today i still play homm3 every year and this is the first game that has come out since that really feels like a true competitor;76.5;1.0;1.0;146.0;17 May, 2022;False;430

2942;Songs of Conquest;early access review this game is great things that i would like improved are  more races obviously  neutral camp races so not just neutral camps of playable factions  a change to the magic system for i think it is too linear and i dislike how all races use roughly the same simple spells i would like to see unique magic for each race this is the biggest complaint i have about the game currently  random map generator  being able to take turns at the same time as other players in multiplayer    overall i think this is an amazing game and really scratches the homm itch for me;23.2;1.0;0.0;125.0;20 May, 2022;False;578

3055;Songs of Conquest;early access review at this point songs of conquest is a gorgeous stable and a mechanically bit lacking but modern reiteration of the homm formula i believe it has a long journey ahead of it and im happy to be there for it all the way till the end the potential is crazy and the devs convinced me that they care about the game and willing to take feedback to their heart for the first time ever im actually willing to report bugs the game has a pleasant in-game bug reporter and provide suggestions to support the team thats how special the game is for me  i hope ubisoft takes notes;14.4;1.0;0.0;114.0;22 May, 2022;False;583

3111;Songs of Conquest;early access review just started playing it game is gud it definitely has that let me play one more turn thing to it which is a mark of a good turn-based game  despite being obviously inspired by homm it has plenty of its own mechanics to be unique  the visuals and the music are fantastic  i will be playing more of this;17.7;1.0;2.0;168.0;21 May, 2022;False;321

3120;Songs of Conquest;early access review games concept is great however the ai is way overpowered when first starting the game and learning the ropes need to have an easy setting for campaign no list of hotkeys- graphics could be sharpened so objects can be seen clearer will be a great game when tweaked to balance the overpowered ai wait for future updates unless you want to support developers which should be done only voting no until game is not so difficult;13.7;0.0;6.0;112.0;17 May, 2022;False;442

3124;Songs of Conquest;early access review gorgeous art marred by repetitive dull combat half-arsed uninteresting magic system and a world-map that trades meaningful exploration for a mobile-like clickathon as you meander from area to area aggressively clicking on whatever interesting sprites are in your way  i was lured in by the comparisons to homm but this has none of the depth anyone making favourable comparisons or even stating this is better than homm 2/3 has obviously never played them songs of conquest is more like kings bounty albeit simplified;1.5;0.0;10.0;201.0;16 May, 2022;False;536
3126;Songs of Conquest;early access review basically what most turn-based strategy purists are saying on their negative reviews  the game is pretty quick it seems like the developers have focused more on creating a game that works for streams rather than a complex strategical game i dont think this issue will be addressed as its a core problem with the games foundation  go play homm 3 or 5 and hope that ubisoft sells the ip to a developer that cares;7.0;0.0;6.0;153.0;17 May, 2022;False;430
3127;Songs of Conquest;early access review the game is good but the person that built the campaign is retarted in mission 3 you start with nothing and have to beat 3 hard ai with full monster armies forget about it they didnt play their own game its not ready yet  dont buy wait for more 3 years at least;7.1;0.0;6.0;251.0;21 May, 2022;False;281

3129;Songs of Conquest;early access review pro  - good music - pixel graphics look nice  con  - sadly the most important part the combat is shallow and dumbed down moreover it gets boring super quick and theres no real strategy involved but pure masses of stacks colliding - limited building / research options - no voice overs - story seems bland - magic is super boring with generic +10 defense spells and dmg spells not being interesting or impactful - items boring with only + stats;4.6;0.0;5.0;215.0;19 May, 2022;False;463
3130;Songs of Conquest;early access review not in a very balanced state at the moment the difficulty curve when you get to mission 4 death to diplomacy is ridiculous they have 3 wielders rock up at the same time with armies far greater than you can get just one your spells are give your dudes +10 defence their spells are nuke your side of the battlefield  ill give it another go when theres some balance patches its a fun game and it has a lot of potential but for now its completely lopsided  edit also the auto resolve battle is awful i send my main wielder into an easy battle and they get wrecked;10.2;0.0;3.0;635.0;22 May, 2022;False;579

3135;Songs of Conquest;early access review pretty game but i had a hard time figuring out what all the buildings were supposed to do and left certain areas not realizing i didnt control a building in a village you have to tap on them all independently trying to upgrade some buildings that i had resources for didnt result in anything  i know its early access and changes will be made and many things will become clear as the game bakes but theyre charging money or a product and i dont believe this is worth the cost in its current state;0.8;0.0;7.0;937.0;19 May, 2022;False;515
3136;Songs of Conquest;early access review would love to recommend this game but in its current state i cant if im playing with more than 1 other ai player it slows the game down to a crawl with how bad everything lags and even if you do push through and get to play for an hour it will then freeze up completely on you this has happened in every single game ive tried to play;7.3;0.0;14.0;153.0;16 May, 2022;False;353

3143;Songs of Conquest;early access review its not a bad game 7/10 i would say but im a bit salty because  hero level limit in the campaign missions is low and ive picked learning bonus exp perk - seriously why is there a learning perk in the campaign at all if you cant really take advantage of it also - before you finish a mission you need to return all the artifacts to the main hero otherwise they are gone forever;12.2;0.0;7.0;414.0;22 May, 2022;False;396

3297;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2;early access review while still in very early access at the time of this review the promise is still immense the first game in the series is nothing more than a gimmick ill admit it however in this follow up title the developer has promised many features that will take this game from a couple hours of fun to a full on competitor with the total war series millions of units fighting in battles entire valleys filling with rivers of blood and hopefully steam workshop support for custom units soon;3.0;1.0;1.0;169.0;17 May, 2022;False;497
