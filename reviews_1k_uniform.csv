I lean on the side of recommending this game, however it seems like something about it makes me both love it and hate it. I enjoy the game play and the styling of it makes it enjoyable. But I feel like the art or game play just doesn't fit all together. Its not terrible, but it just seems like its lacking something. Like a song without a chorus. Feels like its got some good versus and its going somewhere, but it just doesn't feel complete.

I'd definitely keep this game on deck if you're on the fence about getting it, but if you feel like scratching an itch for some card battling then maybe this will be your scratch post.";0.4;1.0;0.0;816.0;Posted: March 30

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have stated, FTL meets slay the spire.

HUGE potential here. I think a few things need reworked.

1. Balance: jmzero's review goes in depth.

2. No discard pile: this i feel is an odd design choice, since there's no discard pile, all cards used immediately go back to the deck, so attaining any new card is a constant lower percentile of getting any card in your deck on every turn. So you may never see your new card in play...ever. Since the deck is *shuffled* every turn. This is poor design, you cant structure synergy here, as you are constantly threatened to draw the same cards over and over. This just feeds into the balance problem, of ""just grab the most OP cards and scrap the rest""

3. Easy exploits: Again jmzero, nailed most of it. I will add shields (especially after unlocking a particular ship) are VERY exploitable. You can turtle up, create drones forever, and heal any dmg that gets by.

4. All events: now jmzero went over the crates. however, many ? events are lackluster. you find a trader...repair your ship...get fuel...sell fuel...etc. the only promising one is the temple ruins, but even that is just a choice of getting more credits at expense of fuel and hp, 5 times. Also to add to the crate, it doesn't help that the literal ""do-nothing"" iteration of that event can soft-lock the game!! (had it happen twice where the pop up doesn't go away ever, the event never ends, and i have to alt F4

4a. Slow-event handling: any pop-up, event, etc. is just slow to show up or finish.

even with these issues i can recommend this considering the alpha state. Potential buyers, i would say if you like FTL and slay the spire and want to support the devs, go for it, otherwise, wishlist it and wait.";9.3;1.0;36.0;292.0;Posted: 27 July, 2020

This is a tentative recommendation.
Like many others have said, the game is fun but some things just don't work as you'd expect.
It's less a deck-builder and more a card pool-builder - you have discard & draw mechanics, but cards don't play in any sort of deck order. You can draw the same card in every hand, and never see others even over many turns.
The ability to explore sectors is cool, but it's not very useful and can encourage you to time-waste. Having played this I can understand why FTL has an enemy fleet chasing you. It's quite possible to become self-sufficient (gaining fuel with every battle & self-repairing) and clean out an entire sector, but there's little value to doing so - you'll have loads of money without anything useful to spend it on and just see the same two groups of enemies over and over.";36.3;1.0;15.0;693.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'd recommend the game, with the caveat that it can be very frustrating, partly due to a few bugs, and how the game currently works.

I really enjoy building a deck, but it does feel too random in how you receive cards and equipment, even how you discard the cards is down to chance encounters - which makes trying to keep a lean deck really hard, unless you want pass on better cards to hold onto lots of weaker ones. Perhaps allowing the player to scrap more than one card at a time between gates, pay to ""refit"" at a shipyard,
(you can do this at big stations, but these are rare, and its very expensive so that only 1 or 2 cards are possible) or simply ""jettison"" equipment (it costs nothing, but you make nothing either) would help?

There are a few bugs:

* Occasionally pop up windows don't disappear - which can obscure the map and your ship, so you can't click to choose a direction (you can use WASD and QEZX as a workaround).
* WASD etc are not disabled when in at a space station, so it's possible to accidentally move, and exit the space station before you've done anything. Which isn't great since the space stations disappear after each visit.

Anyway, I hope that feedback helps make the game better. Despite all of the above I'm looking forward to future updates!";64.5;1.0;0.0;80.0;Posted: January 17, 2021

I have decided that i'm am going to try and get myself more involved with card games like this one, i received the product for free after hearing from a friend that he got it and rather liked it, and very glad that i did. First of all the art style i love it, gotta say though i am a sucker for pixel art, the music is very good as well and the game play is solid how it flows from map to battle sequence back to map. Id have to give this maybe a 8/10 and its still in early access so it can only go up.

If you like the gameplay of ""Slay the spire"" and the scifi setting of ""FTL"" then you'd probably like this game. However, there are a few caveats.

1. VERY glitchy: I have had numerous occasions. HOWEVER, nothing has broken a run (IE, the UI broke, the event stopped working as usual, ect.) without being fixed by quitting to the main menu and just continuing. However, this has reset one event where I got an epic equipment and made it as if it didn't exist.

2. NO EASY STATUS ICON. if you get set on fire, you have to see it on the combat log. otherwise something happens and you wonder ""Why the heck did I lose a card this turn"" or ""Where did that 2 damage come from?""

However, in my time of playing, nothing has hampered the FTL-esque random encounter combat too badly and the combat (other than the occasional glitch that makes shields ""NON"", as well as the status thing.) too heavily.

overall, 7/10. quite fun in short bursts but can be a bit repetitive if playing for longer periods. Needs some updates and bug fixes but overall is fine.";40.0;1.0;0.0;66.0;Posted: April 4

I enjoyed this game quite a bit, enough to play for 30 hours, but I really wish there was more meta progression (and more content!) Ships and difficulty modes are the only unlocks, and I feel it would be much more engaging/addictive if there was something more to unlock, such as different cards or bonuses. The atmosphere is good, and I enjoyed the music and art style for what it is. I did think the giant ""FTW!"" after every battle was kind of childish and annoying, but I got used to it eventually. I'd like to see some different enemies, as on some maps I felt like I was just fighting the same three enemies on every battle (yawn.) The RNG didn't bother me as much as some other people, I felt it added a layer of strategy and use for the hand-manipulating cards. I also liked that you could save mid-run. All in all, if you enjoy roguelike deckbuilders and a space setting, you'll probably have fun with this one for a little while.";32.1;1.0;1.0;522.0;Posted: April 9

Pros:
Good core mechanics, if unpolished and a bit clunky in execution atm.
Good play dynamic with the right additions I could see this being something I would heavily play and return to later; not sure if it has the full potential of FTL/Slay the Spire but it could depending on further developments.

Cons:
Feels like it has 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards necessary to make it reasonably dynamic.
Lacks the item variation and customization of Slay the Spire [though if you could upgrade to slot more equipment and/or they added basic ship upgrades of some sort.]
Only system variation seems to be enemies [no FTL environmental dangers, or crew flavor]
Deck randomization does functionally only reward a small deck

This game has a lot of potential. I dig the art style, and I like the gameplay. It can be seen that this is early access, there are some graphical inconsistencies (like loose anything that isn't pixelart from a pixelart game) and balance issues, and some cards doesn't work properly or not at all. Or the description of some cards not accurate, or just not contains enough info.
The ""deckbuilding"" part is strange to me, and this is what I didn't really liked. I can choose to have a card or not, I can hardly get rid of cards that I don't need, if I'm unlucky, I won't get the cards I need the most. So it has a lot of randomness to it. But what would Space RNJesus do? :D He would still recommend it and hope that in the future, the finished game will have more balance, and some more content and he would play through this game again.";50.3;1.0;0.0;266.0;Posted: November 22, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
An engaging and well executed sci-fi roguelike deckbuilding card game, where you play as a sort of rogue trader that sees his route cut off when returning with a large shipment of goods (last big score kind of situation). As a result, you have no option but to try to survive by traversing though the galaxy's most dangerous paths.

This game has, simply put, amazing pixel art and music. The mood is perfect for its genre and you will, for certain, sometimes stop just to appreciate it visually.

In terms of gameplay, the card mechanics play as a space battle, based on 4 elements - attack, shield, status effects and deck manipulation. So far I'm really liking the type of synergies you can create between cards and the amount of variation already existing. As for your ship, in this version, you start the game by selecting from only two types of ships, with different characteristics, but more are planned.

To be clear, you can tell that it's an Early Access game from the amount of existing content and a few balancing issues it still has. However, the developer is clearly listening to players and using feedback to improve overall balance (I got the game on itch.io, where he did a soft-launch, to get feedback as soon as possible, for that exact purpose). Furthermore, his roadmap already includes more content and his updates have been quite frequent, always adding new stuff and fixing issues as they arise.

Overall, I'd say the game is very promising and already quite fun. A definite recommend!";9.0;1.0;3.0;206.0;Posted: March 27, 2020

This game is extremely fun, even for me, someone who is new to this genre. The cards in this game are pretty broken, so it's really fun just to destroy your enemies. Most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive. My only issue is the last ship's deck being drones and shields. While I understand it's suppose to be a defensive play style, it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks, even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card. I would probably buff the shield cards, but it's not a big deal. Overall, a fun game with crucial decision making, wits, and rng.";15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;Posted: April 22, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Alright, I normally don't do reviews on Steam, however this game has made me make an exception. The easiest way for me to describe this game at the time of writing is FTL: Faster Than Light mixed with Slay the Spire with a slight influence from tactical rpg's. That being said, there are a few issues at the moment I have noticed, however it could just be my PC at the moment. First issue is in the intro cut-scene the audio jacks up near the end and transfers into the map. Second issue I found is the random encounter that shows all PoI (Places of Interest) on the map, causing a soft lock, however going to main menu then pressing continue resets the tile and allows you to continue playing. Third issue I found is when you run out of fuel, you click the arrow, the distress beacon dialogue appears in which you lose some credits and gain five fuel.

The combat is good. I like the shield system where you can rollover shields to next turn, unless you have the Kinetic Shield card or something else along those lines, however I will say the GUI during combat is not my friend. The GUI is beautiful, however there are no tool-tips except for equipment. If I ignite the enemy, I have to remember how much ignite is on the enemy, how much damage it might do, etc. I see the icon under the enemy, I just don't have any information to work with regarding that aspect.

Synergies is an interesting concept. I like them to be honest, and with the estimated 80 cards you're more likely to encounter synergy cards. It makes the actual deck-building fun, and you can get some pretty interesting combinations. If you find an Ignite synergy with Nova Strike it's beautiful.

Deck-building: In all honesty, I haven't messed around with this all too much. I have noticed that removing cards from your deck is a much more difficult process than adding cards to the deck. There's a few random encounters that allow you to remove cards, and it's a beautiful sight that makes a grown man cry with joy.

Overall, I would pick this game up if you like FTL and/or Slay the Spire. There's a few things that could deal with a bit of polish or reworking, but otherwise it's a good game.

I love the art style and design of the game. I have beaten the game on hardcore and draft with every ship. The game in its current state is very minimalistic. Each run through you need to eliminate most of the starter cards. Mass Driver is essential for every single deck, this card needs to have a chance to be permanently destroyed each time it is used. I can make perfect draw decks with Mass Driver. The game is very easy simply by getting a few heal cards and getting as many +to max shield cards. What the game lacks most is meaningful interactions with aliens. They need to hire some cartoonists or comic strip writers to make some satirical and fun interactions with aliens. The game is too easy, I can gauranteed win every single run through by farming a zone. This game needs to take a note from Slay the Spire and Hades by adding some scaling difficulty modifiers to keep players challenged and interested. I do recommend this game, but many updates need to come.";120.3;1.0;3.0;130.0;Posted: February 26, 2021

Nice artwork, nice tunes... The only truly negative thing I can say about the game is its overreliance on RNG. I get it's meant to be a ""roguelike"" but the balance or lack thereof is all over the place. I can't begin to tell you the number of runs ended in the first sector because of several clusters of enemies that all spam their attacks and leave you at half or less health past the first encounter; then the sector one enemies that enjoy their 10 ~ 23 damage attacks.

Yes, enemy attack values vary wildly unlike yours which are static. Their 'Burn damage' also pierces/ignores your Shields/Block while yours can't do the same.

That said, it's still entertaining for what it is but if the talk about its balancing or lack of certain elements common to deckbuilders of this kind puts you off, I'd suggest waiting for a sale or watching someone else play it before deciding.";9.8;1.0;0.0;701.0;Posted: April 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I originally bought this game on itch.io in December, back when it was in alpha 0.2.3, so I have a lot more hours in the game than what is reflected on Steam. It's been really cool to see how much work the devs have put into it in just a few short months.

In a nutshell, FTW is a roguelike where you move a spaceship through several sectors of a galaxy toward a goal, sort of like FTL, but the combat uses cards (which are shaped like 3.5 inch floppies and are cute as hell) with different skills and effects, similar to Slay the Spire. Because the loot and maps are randomized, each game is unique and there are many different play styles you can go for in your deck. So, I think it has a good amount of replay value, even in this early alpha stage of development.

I love the pixel art. I love the music and hope they add more. I love the little references (""twisted firestarter"") and the quirkiness of some of the enemies. It's a fun game and I appreciate the insane amount of work they've put into it in just the three or so months since I bought it.

At this point (alpha 0.5.0) my biggest complaint is money. It's too easy to acquire and that makes it too easy to buy a lot of overpowered equipment at shops. I think either money should be more rare, or that loot should get progressively more expensive. That, I think, would help balance the game and make it more difficult. It's a roguelike, after all. It's supposed to be hard! Aside from that, I think they've got a good thing going here and I look forward to seeing what else they do with it in future builds.";16.1;1.0;0.0;154.0;Posted: March 29, 2020

IN A WORD: MAYBE
IN A NUTSHELL:
WHAT TO EXPECT:
Indie made. Space-faring roguelike. Futuristic sci-fi setting. Procedurally generated 2.5D star map. Turn-based strategic exploration. 2D side-on, turn-based card battler. Ship vs ship tactical combat. Session only deck-building. Requires constant deck management. RNG can cause heavy imbalance. Imbalance makes it very challenging. Quality pixel graphics & art. Matched by synth-pop soundtrack. Short on content. Some variety of components. Made to be replayable. Singleplayer only







For the Warp provided a mixed experience which has some surprisingly involved card-driven space combat. However, the hefty use of RNG gives it an unbalanced nature. One that is further complicated by a lack of mechanisms to limit its impact. Some gamers may find its content on the low side, but it has been made to be replayed. Very likely the reason for its steep difficulty curve.















For the Warp is a well made but unbalanced game. Strategic gameplay is good but could do with a few more additions and added variation. Tactical combat is at times an enjoyable experience with several viable strategies and synergies available. However, the substance deck-building possesses is affected by a level of RNG that causes its overall difficulty to rise steeply, detrimentally impacting balance.

This results in a frustrating experience which is why its rating falls from being worthwhile to a purchase, though only just.";17.5;1.0;21.0;923.0;Posted: 10 April

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
FOR THE WARP definitely a game i will be playing for a long time. Its a deck builder where you start out with a bunch of cards which during the course of your journey you can trade or sell for resources such as fuel, new weapons and ship upgrades etc. Card selection is vast and it all makes sense with the science fiction theme and how they play out. Combat is fun where you can win if you play your cards right :) even when it seems the odds against you. Keeping your shields fully charged is very important to prevent physical ship damage. You will meet others in your travels who can provide repairs for something in return or give you fuel when your running low. I think one time someone even did this for free.

When defeating a boss you will unlock a new ship with new gear adding the variety of things that can be done. Maps are areas of space you can cross any way you want while trying to avoid too many hostile encounters as you attempt to get to the warp exit location. The maps are full of random encounters such as distress calls and ruined civilizations where something foreboding happened in the past. You will also come across merchant zones where you can purchase new cards.

Music is good though at the moment i believe there are only like two or three songs. One for exploration and another for combat. Since its early access many are hoping more music will be added.

This one is tough for me and may come across as a negative review, but it really isn't. I absolutely adore the overall idea of this game. A spaceship version of Slay the Spire? Hell yes! However, it often feels like it's deliberately holding the player back from having too much fun.

The game ends a zone or two too soon, right when your build is the most fun to play. The Hardcore mode levels up as you play Normal and Draft, but there's no way to level it back down again. It's stuck at Level 10 for me which makes the first zone nearly impossible out the gate. Speaking of Draft mode, it's my favorite, but some ships are just plain better for it than others, which is sad. I wish each ship had more tangible differences than just the amount of hull/shields it starts with. It's also difficult to build an efficient deck without predictable scrapping opportunities. The shop card offerings are very limited and there's no way to sell back excess equipment. I'm often swimming in credits and loaded down in stuff I don't want but can't get rid off. Definitely detracts from the overall fun of the experience.

Is it worth the price? Sure, but I was really hoping for more longevity from it. I'm giving it a recommend because I've had a good deal of fun with it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Also, the game would be PERFECT for Steam Workshop. I can already imagine the awesome mods the community could create.";36.0;1.0;1.0;332.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Super Short Review:
This game is an absolute gem and well worth picking up if you enjoy deck-building and space-themed strategy.

Slightly Longer Review:
If you enjoy Slay The Spire or similar deck-building games and you have played space-themed titles like Eve Online and Elite Dangerous... oh boy, will you enjoy this game.

It's a super well polished approach to the genre, featuring beautiful pixel art, a catchy soundtrack and great game design. The hints of lore in this Alpha version already have me intrigued about all the ""races"" and very distinguishable ship designs, the ""oomph"" of card synergy power is very well executed, the feeling of challenge and the achievement when you beat each of the bosses is on point and it even had me gasping at certain random encounters (that I won't spoil) I did not expect, but have left me further intrigued.

I have only managed to collect a single ""legendary"" grade card so far but it already had me working to build a deck around it and I could not put the game down until I managed to unlock all the ships available so far and take them for a spin.

Overall, I am very eager to continue playing and for all the ways I can see this game growing towards its 1.0 release. I can estimate that the content in this current build will probably have me playing it for around 10 hours, but I will definitely follow its development for the chance to play more For The Warp.

A great game that will only get exponentially better as it gets more content.";8.1;1.0;2.0;171.0;Posted: April 9, 2020

I've only spent a couple hours in the game, but Im loving it so far! Great mechanics, fun gameplay, and interesting locations and enemies. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys either FTL or Slay the Spire. Im very excited to see what content there is left to discover and what the devs will change and add in later in the development process. My only suggestions would be to add some UI to the in battle screen so we can see things like how much money we have while in battle and and Ui resizing for when the game goes into full screen. the game also is a little glitchy at times in battle, but Im sure thats something that will get smoother later on.

Like the little brother of Slay the Spire and FTL.
If you like one of these, you will also like this. The pixel art is nice, the hard combos are fun, and the gameplay is very fluid with clear UI and nice feedback. The game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature. Sometimes the runs are hard, sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo, both are rewarding.
Right now, the content is still less than FTL and StS, but both these game are unusual for the replayability.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For The Warp is a good game in the making. I've put a decent amount of time into it at the time of this review (about 15 hours or so) and I feel like I've seen pretty much everything the game can throw at me by now. There are definitely some cool combos (I personally enjoy the 0 cost discard cards with the 'draw cards and gain energy when you discard' equipment) and fun gameplay but there are definitely some balance issues.

After a few run-thrus, you quickly realize that some strategies are just better than others because the cards needed for those strategies are the best cards. When I get a bad first shop and don't find many useful early cards in the first area, I end up just starting over because my deck doesn't have the defensive capabilities to survive multiple fights in the second phase. If you need specific cards to progress past the early stages of the game (I'm looking at you barrel roll/cloaking device) then what's the point of adopting any other early strategy that doesn't best support these cards?

An example of a game that I think has perfected the 'balance' concept is Slay the Spire. Any strategy can win the game if you are smart about how you play it and get the key cards/relics you need for that strategy. This game can get there, but it definitely needs work. I will say though that it's a good time while you figure it out, but once you've figured out what works and what doesn't it feels a bit stale.

I still think it's worth picking up though as long as the developers are actively making good changes to the game. Being a part of the evolution of a good game is pretty exciting and if you're okay with hitting a few snags here and there, go for it. Just remember that it's still a work in progress.";38.8;1.0;0.0;45.0;Posted: April 1, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has a lot of potential. I like its style and base mechanics. But it's hard to really see the good parts in this game right now because of some fairly dire problems:

1. Balance. There doesn't seem to be any kind of ""base rate"" these cards are built on. Like, there's a card that increases shield capacity by 1 for 1 energy. Another card charges shields by 10 for 1 energy. Another card makes a 4/2 drone for 2 energy. There's also a card called ""AI Supremacy"" that gives you 10 shield capacity, 10 shield charges, and 4 4/4 drones. Going by the established rates, this card should cost at least 19 (ignoring the fact that it also gives you all these effects in one card). Instead it costs 3. Yes it's ""mythic""... but that should mean it's maybe twice as good, not 6 or 10 times as good. Having cards this strong makes your strategy and the enemy's strategy irrelevant - you just play your card and win. Things won't be perfectly balanced... but I feel like there could be a better attempt here.

2. Easy Exploits. Like Slay the Spire, it feels like health is a resource that should slowly exhaust through a stage, and most game mechanics here seem to suggest this was the plan. But there's a card that heals you and doesn't ""deactivate"". This means it's easy to kill all but one enemy, shield up, and loop through your deck until you're healed to full. I think there's one for credits too. You shouldn't be able to get these kinds of effects so easily (ie. with a single card and some patience). Learn the lessons of the other games in this space. These cards should exhaust.

3. Do-nothing events. Whatever is in the mysterious crate, don't have it be nothing. Again, I get this is early access... but I've played the game twice, and it feels like I've opened 6 empty crates. Events don't need fancy graphics or something - just placeholder in _something_.

Anyway, if I was you, dear reader, and if I was looking for a game to play now - I'd add this game to my wishlist, and come back to it once it has had a little more time to bake. But you shouldn't forget it, because I think it could be good.";4.6;1.0;252.0;493.0;Posted: 28 March, 2020

I like the look, the theme and general direction this game is taking. Pixel art spaceships and roguelike.....take my credits! But For the Warp (FtW) makes you appreciate FTL, Slay the spire (StS) and many other roguelikes;

I am not enjoying the gameplay right now. It feels very RNG heavy and I'm constantly getting my butt kicked. The first ship is not very good with it's measly shield cap of 10hp and you will routinely run into groups of 3 enemies who hit for 9dmg each a round. Bosses hit for 10-20, and mid sized enemies can also do 10-20 damage. It's very hard to keep your shields up while also putting up an offense. The second ship is immediately better boasting 15shield cap and a ton of attack and draw cards. The game drastically gets more fun in the second ship, but the world is still wonky and not set up in an approachable way. I hope the other ships are cooler still but I don't feel inspired to play more and unlock them.

The grid you fly around on is frustrating. I find I""m getting bombarded with enemies, then bombarded with allied ships but there isn't any way for me to know ahead of time what I will run into. In FTL you could see the whole region and make a guess at which routes to avoid and which ones would be better. In FtW you only know one space ahead and backtracking costs precious fuel. You will run out resources.

In SlayTheSpire you could also plan ahead how many bosses/rests/merchants you'd roughly encounter. In FtW you can't plan at all. I""m often sitting outside the boss gate with 10%hp and not enough fuel to explore for help. Was I supposed to power through in a straight line? How many encounters should I risk for loot? It's incomprehensible.

I miss that in FTL the stations all offered the same services. You could always buy fuel, repair and purchase from a wide variety of weapons, drones and ship upgrades. SlayTheSpire had a similarly good merchant who offered card removal and card upgrades along with his RNG items. FtW could really benefit from stable merchants. The cost of fuel and repair is wildly different and making that last fuel jump to a station that doesn't sell fuel is very frustrating. I could see space games drop fuel as a mechanic if I""m honest.

The merchants in FtW would be better if they had actual selection. Three cards and one equipment is silly small. There are many deck styles you could build in this game. Either make the cards cheaper so that you can buy a large number and design your play deck and side deck, or give the players way more selection. In one instance I had a significant amount of money, and I bought more equipment than I could use, but there is nothing you can do with it afterwards. No merchant buys equipment from you and it's not relevant to any story based encounters. So if you don't plan on using the cards, you can't reliably get rid of them and they don't serve a story purpose....can I send the out the airlock?

Ultimately I want this game to be good but I don't like it right now. I am leaving a down vote so that the Devs see this feedback, but I also hope that other players will play the game in hopes that the devs get the resources they need to continue. I won't be refunding and will keep my fingers crossed that some of my concerns are addressed, or that other improvements are made.";2.1;0.0;19.0;220.0;Posted: 29 March

I've played a lot of FTL and Slay the Spire as well as many other deckbuilding/exploration/roguelikes. They are my favorite games, and so I was sad that this one missed the mark for me. It looked right up my alley, but the problem was that there was just too much RNG in the way without a lot of time to counter it. I couldn't find the mechanic to scrap cards fast enough so my deck became bloated fast, and I kept running into unavoidable unwinnable fights. I investigated one space and fought some mega-ship that did 30-50 damage a shot. I had the card to escape a combat but I was dead before I drew it.

And why is my starting hand only 3 cards? When there are three ships each swinging for 9 damage on the first round and I draw 3 base attacks it's not much help. Also, 3-9 is not an acceptable range of damage for me to plan around, nor is 10-18. That's too much control for the RNG to have and I'm not interested in continuing to play until the RNG gods deem it appropriate for me to win.

I do like that your shields carry over if you don't use them, but that just means I over-shield every time and only attack when I'm above the max shield. shrink the ranges, or maybe do away with them altogether, but at least shrink them.

I'm more than willing to keep trying and to figure it out, but then there is the issue that the core mechanics were not very fun. I don't see why I need to select my ship in order to shield if I'm the only ship that's there that logically I would want to shield. Explain to me why I have to select a ship to attack if there is only one target. It would be more fun if there was a right-click default action for cards that are obvious on how a general player would use them.

Also, the cutscenes and dialog aren't fast enough for me. Put the text up there, allow me to hit enter to skip it. Every single time you approach something t h e g a m e h a s t o m a k e y o u w a i t t o r e a d t h e d e s c r i p t i o n and it bores me every time. I read fast and I don't play games to be bored. Maybe there's a setting to control this in the options, fine, but whatever the fastest setting in should be the default and there should be a setting to slow it down if you like long-drawn out time to read text because I'm going to go ahead and assume that's the minority.

It's very possible this game could hook people but for me there are too many games out there without these issues, so I can't recommend trying this out.

The game is ok, but the total randomness of the cards really detracts. Starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships.

This is a tentative thumbs down. Beat the game on my second or third run when I realized you sometimes just get an amazing equipment (like permanent +1 energy) right at the start of the game and it's essentially a free win. Lots of unbalanced cards and strange design decisions, doesn't quite have the replay factor or the alternatives (Slay the Spire, Monster Train, heck even FTL). Fun quick little game with quite a few cards which surprised me but no balance or ""satisfaction"" for a lot of events. Very repetitive. I love the art style but the execution is bland.

I don't quite want to give this game a bad review but it desperately needs some balancing, more events, and more varied fights. Seems like a very early release for something that still seems like a beta

Missing UI and information
- Does a drone get hit when you take damage? Is it random? How does drone HP work?
- What's my max HP? If you have cards that act on a ship having 50% HP, I need some indicator of what max health is
- This card generates X card. What is that card?
- Directional moving can be a little hard to parse sometimes

Sometimes the game just...doesn't seem to process correctly. I use all my energy...and still need to click end turn. I purchase a service from an NPC ship...and the screen doesn't progress. I exit to menu and there's no option to continue my in progress game...but I close the game and reopen it and now it shows.

This game has great art and music. It has some great idea. Execution though...this game is still early access. I've had fairly regular bugs. Needs balancing, like there are OP cards that discard your hand but cost all your energy so there's no real downside.

I'd like to come back to this game in a few months but I can't recommend it as is. Hope the dev can make some improvements.";3.6;0.0;2.0;431.0;Posted: March 31

2 things before we begin
1st even though this is a negative review i still enjoy the game, and will probably change this review after a few patches
2nd This is the edited version.

This game is far to RNG heavy, and i think it could be fixed with 1 of 2 things.
Either give us the power to build a deck, by removing or adding cards to your deck, even if it is just at the start of the sector.
Or give us a bigger choice of cards at the start of each Sector.
My reason for this is simple, they is no way of forming a complete build besides random luck.

All that said I did have fun playing and will keep playing but I suggest you wait for a few patches to come out before you buy the game.";11.3;0.0;2.0;306.0;Posted: March 30, 2020

This game is far too barebones currently. There is no real meaningfull synergy. The best way to beat the game is to simply remove cards from your starting deck so that you can fill it with cards that cost 0 and draws 1. It has cards that are too strong like reversing all enemy intents for 0 energy. It becomes more of a war of how much time do you wish to spend on the save rather than how great of play do you do and how interesting of a deck you can build and due to that there are never any exciting moments where you live on a sliver of health. You can tell from the first three battles if this run will be worth doing or not.

Can't immediately quit and restart a new run easily. Instead forced to sit through laggy menus and scenes everytime. I'm going to re-roll those initial selections A LOT, so I'd rather not waste my time. Everything else is slow too, with no speed-up option. Why does everything take so long? Why can't I click past events?

You only get 3 (maybe 5) trinkets max, so there's no going crazy with those. Most cards seem weak, except for some really busted ones. Deck is reshuffled every turn with no discard pile(??). Better to cull your deck than build one and wait for one of the busted cards. Prices at the shops seem all over the place. Value in general seems could use some reconsidering.

Also buggy with events just not working sometimes, forcing restarts.

Sorry but here isn't middle score just good or bad.
I will change this negative flag if the developer fixing some issue.

Good/OK:
The main concept.
Pixel art.

Less Good:
- Sound average (as comrade Dyatlov would say: ""not good not bad"")
- Music very repetitive but not a big concern (some mp3 in the background can fix it)
- Events variation too few and very ""dry"" - some real surprise or humor it would be shake up the game
- Few ship (3) :yes - I think the dev plan more
- Few combination for upgrade - I know more balance issue

Bad (why am I wrote the review):
- Third Ship the KD Carrier. This ship starter card kit is a joke.
I played through 3 system (kill all enemies on every map) with the second ship (Light Destroyer) and lose with the bad karma - constant bad card and all the Enemy ships hit with max damage...
But the Carrier has only low shield and weak Drone cards at the beginning (most spawn - yes I can select some others at the beginning but they are rare in the first couple of battle) and if I meet the first triad Ship group they instant eat up my Hull - maybe not kill just make it difficult to continue .

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For The Warp has a lot of charm.
The bit-style art is nice, the music is fun and appropriate.
But the game is severely lacking in the balance department.
This lack of balance really makes you relinquish any feeling of real freedom that your choices matter; as you can make every ""perfect"" play and you'll still lose pretty quickly.
The difficulty stacked up against you cannot be overstated, and the constant over-powered opponents are a wall too high to climb with skill, as you'll often feel like the encounters you win are due to pure luck.

Attacks have no ""chance"" to hit either-- just a range of damage it WILL do.
You can never actively evade or dodge. You can never attempt to escape an opponent who is too overwhelming for you.
So you're stuck just watching your whole run get blown away due to a random (and seemingly likely chance) you'll see an opponent who just mops the floor with you.

To add to the difficulty, you start the game with 100 coins and can buy from a selection of 3-4 random cards.
That's it.
You are stuck using your incredibly under-powered deck of actions against opponents which can out-damage you, out-shield you, and have the benefit of numbers on you almost every combat.

You most certainly will run out of fuel EVERY game, as the only way to stay alive, being so severely outgunned all the time, is to try and avoid conflict (and you can't).
You don't make enough money to do anything important, nor will you run across a way to fix your ship's shields.
Running out of fuel will invite even more overpowered encounters to spawn directly on you-- to where you will eventually throw your hands up and put the game back on the shelf.

I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's too unbalanced and you won't want to play very long when you feel like the game constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ you without any determinable merit to the challenge.";0.9;0.0;4.0;353.0;Posted: March 21, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't think I can recommend For the Warp in its current state (January 2021). After three hours, I already beat the game once after 4-5 tries and I don't have that urge to try and beat the game with the other ships like I do in other roguelites.

Encounters are fairly repetitive with low variance and there doesn't seem to be much variety in enemy types. All enemies seem to do mostly the same thing just with varying HP pools. It's not even close to Slay the Spire where different encounters require you to approach the enemies differently.

Card balance seems a little off. A number of cards seem to require you to get other cards to make them useful, but there's no guarantee you're ever even going to see cards of those types. On the other hand, I have been able to make some broken combos using cards that aren't crap on their own.

There's also poor explanation of mechanics. For example, one card I've seen has the Explosive property. It sounds like it's supposed to ignore X% of armor, but it just says 0% on there. Is there something I'm missing? I also still don't understand how the Synergy keyword works with its vague description. Another card tells me it does more damage for each ""Plasma"" type in my hand, but I don't know how to tell if a card is Plasma type or not. I thought maybe it was if the card had ""Plasma"" in the name, but my starter cards with Plasma in the name didn't seem to count.

On a positive note, the game looks and sounds pretty good, although I do wish cards had more on-screen effects. The game also has a twist on deck building where there is no discard, which I find interesting. Cards you play in a turn immediately get sent back and shuffled into the deck. This causes you to approach deck building a little different than the typical deck building approach where you don't reshuffle until you've played your entire deck.

Right now, I think they need to work on card balance and make encounters actually interesting. With every encounter playing out the same, the game gets boring extremely fast.";2.9;0.0;8.0;2352.0;Posted: January 21, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's an intriguing entry in the card-battle genre, but I was disappointed to beat it on the first try! I had a card that gave shields and HP for just 1 energy, and doesn't get removed from your deck, so I was basically invulnerable.

In general, it doesn't feel like much effort has been spent on card balance. I'd recommend getting Slay the Spire, Monster Train, or Griftlands instead.";2.8;0.0;2.0;349.0;Posted: May 12, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There are some interesting concepts here but some weird decisions that, ultimately, I didn't enjoy.

* It's bizarre to me that you start with 3 cards instead of a full deck... No idea why that decision was made (but I'm assuming there is one...?) This means you'll easily take 9-27 damage (probably more later on) without being able to charge your shields or prevent damage (unless you get lucky with your draw on those first three cards) That's my biggest complaint, really. I flew through the first system no problem but died within two encounters on the second system due to this mechanic.

* I enjoyed the sci-fi spaceship/deckbuilding setting and the art is pretty good. Seeing the animations for the corresponding card you played is pretty cool. The backgrounds are bright and colorful and it's always fun to look at. The music was pretty great but seemed to be a bit repetitive?

* 'Burn' (think 'bleed' in other games - damage over time) doesn't take effect until the end of the enemy turn... which is a strange decision as well in my opinion. It doesn't allow the damage to be a real 'game-changer'. You'll take the enemy's attacks and THEN they die... which really hurts your momentum on a run since your HP carries over.

To be fair, I only played this for about 0.4 hours before dying and deciding I didn't enjoy it. It's possible that the game continues to open up as you progress (as deck-building games usually do) I want to like this game and will definitely keep an eye on it as it continues to progress through early access. If you like this genre of game you might really vibe with it... I'm sure I'll pick it up again in the future but I don't think it's something I want to play just yet.";0.4;0.0;0.0;509.0;Posted: September 14, 2021

Really nice on the surface: concept, artstyle, music...the first few runs are really fun.

I really wish I could give a reccomendation, but it's very unbalanced and repetitve:
Either you get the right (aka broken) combinations of cards/upgrades at the beginning: easy win.
Or you don't, then it's almost a guaranteed loss.

Also, some qol improvements would be really nice: clear indicators for active powerups or status effects, support for 21:9 resolutions, etc.

Changes from the early access version are almost not noticable, except the new cards.

This still feels like it's in early access, and could use some work before it's set. At the moment, the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions. Most of the cards you get also just don't see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - they're just small numbers boosts a lot of the time. The idea has potential overall, and it's possible a future version will make notable improvements, but it's currently hard to recommend over the other deck-builder games available on Steam.";2.5;0.0;5.0;919.0;Posted: February 9, 2021

Like other negative reviews, power scaling is strange and basic survival past the first round or two seems to be based on luck if you get shield capacity and energy.
The battles are long and enemies are mostly uninteresting. You just slug away at each other taking turns recharging shields and taking shots.
For the price I think there are many other better deck builders, but it's not awful. The art and theme are very well done.";10.5;0.0;7.0;441.0;Posted: April 6

Terrible game, dont buy it.
It seems like a mix of Slay the Spire and FTL, but with only the worst parts of both games.
- Tedious and boring fights, you are limited to about 2 types of encounters per region which repeats for about 5 to 10 times per region. On top of that, All enemies are essentially the same with different stats, as they largely have the same attack moves.
- Pointsless events, the best part of FTl and Slay the Spire was to step on those question mark tiles and not knowing what to expect. In this game 9 out of 10 times is you get some fuel/ cash or sell/scrap a card for cash.
- Ships that you unlock are the same just with different starting stats and starting deck. Making progression meaning less.
- The equipments that you can find are about as basic as it gets.";7.4;0.0;5.0;93.0;Posted: March 30

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It has the feel of FTL, but plays similar to slay the spire. The biggest turnoff for me, and what ended up causing me to refund it, is that you don't draw from your deck. Every turn, you get 5 random cards out of the cards in your deck. you could get the same hand over and over; it does not cycle through all the cards. For example, In my 21 card deck, I had one copy of a card that boosts the attack of all your active drones and 3 cards that made drones. In one battle (and the battles are decently lengthy) I drew the drone boost card every turn, but never once did I draw a card that made a drone. It was very frustrating. In addition, energy is not saved between turns but shields are (there is a shield capacity), so you can have totally wasted turns where you draw mostly shields and your shields are already at max so the turn just gets wasted.

In short, I enjoyed FTL and slay the spire but found this to be more frustrating than fun.";0.5;0.0;78.0;1004.0;Posted: 8 April, 2020

This needs a good deal of work. It has a lot of promise but being ""so close to release"" and still so buggy and looking so fuzzy/hazy at times. This feels like a mobile game that is getting tested first through Steam and feels like it at times. The aesthetic is nice but even slay the spire has better/smoother animations. Also doesn't bug out as much and lose you cards/money/etc. I'll have to check it out again after release to see if it fixed itself or is mostly aesthetic knockoff of a mobile-but-only-pc slay the spire.";0.9;0.0;1.0;136.0;Posted: April 19, 2021

Way too short and it's not just for the game being in Early Access. I don't see much that could be put into this.
This game has great mechanics, card creation, kinda nice map movement although it's not my favorite, but what bothers me most is time you can play it. Taking similar titles like Faster than light or Into the Breach they give you much more ""replay-ability""
Not taking into considaration Slay the Spire which I'm not going to say this game is based on, but is in similar style yet it makes you play over and over again.

Overall Very nice game but price - play-time ratio is not worth it. I really wish I'm wrong here and devs have some ways like better campain in plan. I would really look forward that";3.3;0.0;3.0;72.0;Posted: August 17, 2020

Unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this. I like the premise, having some elements of FTL but it's extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one, drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile. If they changed this I could see the game being a lot better, but it's restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity. In my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies. It's a refund for now, but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care.";0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;Posted: April 25, 2021

Ultimately disappointing. Listen to other popular negative comments. They're right.

This game struggles from extreme balancing issues. I wouldn't even bother picking this up until they're fixed, if they ever are. The drone carrier, which seems like a super fun ship, can't even get passed the first few battles in Hardcore because you can't keep your drones alive. Basic issues like that stop this game from going up in the ranks of STS type games. Art is super awesome at least.

I also experienced an invincibility bug that made every enemy permanently miss me. Got to see the whole game for free and unlocked everything.

P.S. My time played is way off. I think I'm closer to around 10-12 hours.";26.4;0.0;18.0;938.0;Posted: 18 January

Disappointing. Some builds of the game I couldn't even play because of technical issues (aspect ratio/screen region problems, couldn't detect inputs etc.), but beyond that the game design has very large flaws. There is no disincentive for going to every single square and fighting every single enemy, which makes the entire experience involve no meaningful decision making and having it be extremely tedious and boring. There are large balance issues with certain cards being much too efficient and easy to consistently draw due to deck size. Pass.";2.9;0.0;1.0;85.0;Posted: June 29, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I can't in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could. As other reviews have said, this game has potential. I truly believe this game as good potential, the stuff to become a great game. But, it has an issue. A major glaring issue.

It has no replayability. For a game priced at $21.5 AUD, I would expect there to be some replayability in this game. Now granted, it has done something to that end. There are 5 ships in the game. The problem with those ships however is that they only affect starting cards and stats. Nothing about the run itself changes. Card rewards are the same. Encounters are basically dealt with in the same manner. No special equipment for individual ships. Nothing. Once you start a game, it's all the same.

I can't see myself playing this game again. I am bored. I am bored of this game. I know how I should play now, I know what makes for a good deck of cards and what isn't. I know what all of the encounters are like now. Although on that topic, what's the point in different encounters? The different encounters barely affect by I play. Some encounters will be more health draining then others based on some RNG factors, while others I just pass through not even so much as a scratch. Difficulty isn't what makes encounters different, but the encounters are so similar and samey, that's how I see them. My play-style doesn't change, just how much health I am going to lose.

With the ships not changing how the game itself is run, and the encounters all blurring together. The first couple of runs will be fun, but after that. It's all the same. I can not recommend this game if you value replayability.";5.8;0.0;1.0;112.0;Posted: November 25, 2021

Read, i explain it all.

=> The game DON'T AUTOSAVE ! (or it's totaly bugged)

I was doing a run, was at the end, was going to lose next turn on a boss because RNG hate you, you know'

So i Alt-F4, expecting a save at the start of the battle or just before, how foolish i was. First of all, all my run progress got erased, like i never did it (so bye bye the unlock of ships, still got the success thought, but useless) and worst of all, when i clicked continue, it loaded a save of my previous run !

Another thing very infuriating is the first round of battles, you ONLY draw 3 cards (knowing your hand is limited to five), so basicaly, you got enemies who are mostly going to hit you first round, and a good amount of time, you are just defenseless because jesus, you only have 3 CARDS, did you realize how much it's horrible more you advance in the chapters ? Taking free damages for this reason only is stupid, just let us got a basical 5 cards starting hand for god sake.

Also, ION attacks aren't considered attacks for counter maneuvering, nor even ofensives non-direct attacks actions.

Other problem, there isn't enough explanations on your cards (when your mouse is on it), you mostly are like ""wtf this is doing"" and there is no glossary to explain in game.

Another obscure thing who is, there is no discarded deck, so all discarded cards return to your deck, this mean you can draw a tons of cards before having the ones you need because of RNG, this isn't logic. Plus, there is so little numbers of stations or other who can scrap cards, worst of it is the stations who does it, does it only one time, and the best (very rare) stations who do it repeatidly do it for a huge cost.

Talking about stations, there is a true problem for the fuel, you can't really take the time to explore, but you can't really go in one line because not every station sell fuel, it's mostly rare or costly.

Right now, don't take too much cards in your deck even if you can have a ton, because of the 3 cards starting hand and the fact there is (it seems) no discard deck, and scraping cards is too rare or too costly. The problem ? It seems you can endlessly got the sames cards before pulling the ones you desperately need.

And i just played in normal.

Early Access review: mostly entertaining but seems to make no attempt at balance. A balance pass will presumably come before the launch from Early Access (post-Early Access update: nope, no apparent attempts at balance). If the Heart of the Cards smiles on you, you will draw amazing combos for free or not need combos at all due to single-card win conditions. Or occasionally you will roll up to an enemy who will immediately attack for more damage than your hull+shields combined while you draw no defense.

FTW doesnt have much of a story. If any story.
It is lacking in ways to make the playable ships different. All ships draw from the same card pool.

The boss fights are just a big bag of health points.

Like other reviews have said, the draw mechanic is nonsensical. You don't draw a card from the top, you draw it from a pool. So you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them.

Finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire. Got nothing for it, Hardcore didn't even unlock. Game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others. Art is pretty nice, the theme is good. Ran into several bugs.

Misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun. Poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable. There are also a lot of poor design decisions, like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible: Stack as much shield as possible every turn, then spend remaining energy on attack cards, with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing.";7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;Posted: April 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have pointed out, this game has a lot of great features and has some compelling gameplay. However, there are three things that kill it for me because they lead too far down the path of heavy RNG.

1) The shuffler makes no sense. The fact that you don't discard cards and that every time you draw a hand that you are pulling from your entire deck is against the foundation of what a deck builder game is supposed to be. It has all of the other facets of how to build and manipulate your deck but the player should be drawing from a shuffled stack and continue to do such until the discard pile needs to be shuffled back in. I might have been less opposed to this if you could freely discard cards from your deck without needing to pay for it or have NPC's want to buy them during events. But as it stands, it is far to easy to get a 18-20 card deck and that is far too much RNG when doing pool draws.

2) Draft mode is not worth playing due to the design of ships and certain cards. Each ship has a core deck archetype that goes with them. To top it off, you are shown 10 cards to pick from, then 9, then 8, etc. While this would certainly be what you would experience playing Magic: the Gathering, the cards do not have enough synergy to interface with each other in this format let alone to build a half way viable starter deck that matches the ship you selected. Also, you select the ship BEFORE you draft which should be the other way around. See what comes to you and what archetype you can build towards then decide what ship you want. The problem stated in #1 compounds this since you might not have that many shield cards and drawing them when you are getting blasted for 40 damage a round in the first map is not a good experience.

3) While playing in normal mode, there are certain cards you need to make your ship's archetype deck come together and there is no way to guarantee that you get those. As such, it leads to runs that are destined to fail because you, through RNG, just don't power up your deck to the point that you can handle later encounters. Especially when you get screwed by not drawing what you need from your pool (see #1) for several turns.


I like the premise of the game and it has a great foundation. Hopefully, these issues will get addressed by the developer in the near future as I look forward to playing this game after those patches land.";12.2;0.0;16.0;235.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In it's current form - avoid.

The card design is extremely simple, the diversity between 'ships' limited, the difficulty is extremely low and, perhaps worst of all, it's so utterly slow.

Both because of animation speeds, enemy health/shield pools, and the limited damage output of even your most synergy-dependant, powerful attacks, battles take a very long time by ""roguelite deckbuilder"" standards (though perhaps you may be used to the pace if you've played a lot of Deck of Ashes). But a big issue is that each map - of the 5 you go through for one 'run' of the game - is filled to the brim with enemy encounters and there's very rarely anything stopping you from going through all of them, plus the myriad of beneficial random encounters and 'quest'-like events dragging you back and forth over the map very, very slowly.

I suspect the ""Fuel"" mechanic - as well as your health limits - is intended to prevent you from just fighting constantly for huge quantities of money and other partial benefits, but it fails to function because there are cards that let you easily earn Fuel in-battle, as well as heal in-battle, as well as even permanently remove selected cards from your deck in-battle. As a result, you can easily just leave 1 enemy alive in a battle then spend all of the time you need healing to full, optimizing your deck and restocking your fuel (until the enemy eventually runs away).

In its current state, a very poor handling of in-battle resources with out-of-battle, run-long resources leaves a glacially paced, unfulfilling and fundamentally boring game, lacking inventive classes, deckbuilding, story or much of anything else. I do give some credence to the aesthetic and theming of the game, but even that runs dry quickly when there appears to be as little as 3 (4?) visually distinct enemies per map, and (not counting bosses) seemingly only about 18 or so types of enemies in the game.

And those 18 enemy types are painfully similar. In fact, same with bosses. Enemies just... attack you for X-Y damage, shield themselves (basically self-heal) for X-Y damage, and... that's actually almost it. Occasionally they will take an offensive action like decrease your max shield or place an absolutely trivial damage-over-time effect to you (like ""1 damage over 3 turns"" at a time when enemies are regularly doing 10-14 damage with regular attacks). Occasionally an enemy may spawn a new enemy which... just does the same thing. Deal X-Y damage, shield themselves for X-Y, or do some minor amount of DoT or max shield decrease.

On top of all of the many issues, even if they fixed the ability to exploit battles to maximize all of your resource gains too easily, your cards are both super slow and yet they easily let you break the game. In my first battle, I was just playing a ""barrel roll"" card every turn rendering me literally immune to damage on each turn, and there seemed to be no penalty or limitation to doing so.

Bad balance, minimal content, minimal variety, minimum difficulty, terrible pacing. This is, sadly, probably the worst deckbuilding roguelike game I've played on Steam.";2.9;0.0;4.0;380.0;Posted: August 15, 2020

Elden Ring's open world is massive and gorgeous to behold. There is no shortage of places to explore. It's a welcome departure from its predecessors' on-rails experience.

The game is challenging and engaging. It does not hold your hand, so I recommend paying attention to dialogue, environment and even item descriptions. Some fights can feel punishing until you learn them well.

There is a surprising amount of build depth and variety. You can usually change out your weapon, skills/spells or infusion to counter a difficult boss. Watch the enemies carefully - they all have predictable telegraphs and attack patterns.

There is no cross play with consoles, so keep that in mind if you want to play with friends.";219.3;1.0;0.0;111.0;Posted: May 16

I really enjoy this game, but I don't enjoy it as the way the game was intended to be enjoyed. Kill a giant creature? Great! Rewards! Do more! Feels like how most of the 10 or so friends playing this game enjoy it. When I am playing it I am thinking about the characters within a ruined world who are all struggling for some sense of happiness, that through difficulty and death after death, I am able to offer them. I have only enjoyed this game most when I met a character, and got excited that I got to see another human being. Most of the game is not this however. I get minor joys from traveling and beating a boss feels annoying and pointless to me. The rewards in this game are not great big rewards all the time. Most of the time you are getting minor bonuses for hard fights. Sometimes a cool reward is an exciting thing for me but I never felt that consistently as, when you get to a certain point, you already have all that you need. Most people don't even bother going and fighting bosses blind. Everyone just looks up online where the best items and gear are making the exploration and discovery virtually pointless. The moments of joy in the game, I call joy because they are intense feelings of happiness you get from trudging through difficulty after difficulty to get there, but these joys are far and in between long hours of play. I love open worlds but I also love characters in them. This world feels empty. I barely see any other people and when I do its completely possible I might miss them or kill them, or trigger a fight with them by accident. When I go to places I know people are just to get some modicum of life out of the game, someone to talk to (whether I liked them or not) They always give the same dialogue or are just not there anymore. The game on its own is hard to play not just because of its high difficulty cap, but its way of handling this world and experience is very lonely and dead. That is intentional. This game is supposed to feel that way. Like holding a torch and swinging it in the dark looking for more embers to keep the light going while water rains from above at any random moment, you are fighting the darkness trying to reach some safety, some happiness. That happiness feels all the stronger and more powerful for it. My problem with this game is that on my own I would never have figured that out. I had to look a thing or two up online as well to enjoy it. This game is not for everyone, and it does not feel like it was made for me, but I found some enjoyment in parts of it. I love succeeding in character quest lines and discovering where their stories go. Which is rough because we all know the game barely lets you see them, and their quests are more difficult than the boss monsters of the game to follow. Mostly because you have to fight those boss monsters only to realize that your friend was in a different castle, location, an entirely different continent after MANY HOURS OF JUST LOOKING BECAUSE THE DIFFICULTY CURVE WAS NOT HARD ENOUGH. This game is frustrating. If you are ok with that, and can learn to see a boss kill you on screen, and go ""You know what, that boss has some cool moves. I respect that I died."" and move on, this game is not for you. You will enjoy this game if you like bosses, fighting and killing all my beloved friends. So if you enjoy killing characters for items this game is for you, because killing is all you will do. I will hate you though and I will invade you and rip your organs out. If you played this game for reasons like me? Don't. It gets very lonely when you have no one to talk to. At least I can talk to my friends about this game. That's the only way it was bearable. Good game mechanically. Not for me. Still recommended.";145.6;1.0;0.0;98.0;Posted: May 22

What a game.

I really took my time with this From Soft game. This is the first time I decided to do everything I needed to do for the Platinum in my first run through of one of their games. I kind of regret doing that, because I did have to do a bit of research before continuing through the whole game, but for the most part I played the game blind and what an incredible experience it was.

I cannot get over the talent that this developer has for world design, art style, game mechanics, and did I mention world design? My god. So good.

Every time I would push forward into a new area, whether it was Stormveil, Caelid, Weeping Peninsula, Luirnia, Altus Plateau, Consecrated snowfields, and on and on, every single new push was something completely new, fresh and exciting.
I have seen some complaints online about the fact that they re-used assets and my jaw literally dropped open reading that.. Do they have recurring areas? Of course, but pretty much every single rehash is side areas. Every. Single. major area and legacy dungeons are just completely unique and beautiful.

By the time I got to Altus and saw how wildly different that area was - and by this point I was easily 100 hours into the game, I was just in awe how the game kept surprising me and blowing my mind.

I personally thought every major boss fight was a win except for the Elden Beast one. I just found it annoying and nonstop running around trying to get a single hit and then running around some more. Other than that though, I had a blast.

This game is now the second most played game in my Steam library by hours played only coming behind the Witcher 3 which is one of my favorite games of all time, so that really says something. I am not someone who typically puts hundreds and hundreds (thousands) of hours into games. I like to beat the game, get my enjoyment out of it and then move on to a new experience. So anytime I put upwards of 100 hours or more into a game, you can rest assured it is a game that REALLY held my attention.

My final rating? 9.5/10";184.9;1.0;2.0;333.0;Posted: May 20

interesting to those that wanted an open-world souls game, but for me; Soulsborne + open-world DON'T mix.

Elden Ring is a truly beautiful and well-designed game. This is the first From Software game I have played since the original Dark Souls, which at the time was one of my all-time favorite gaming experiences.

The world is absolutely stunning: My first playthrough I was in awe of the landscapes you happen upon, some of which you aren't even expecting. They were so great I ended up actually buying the looking glass just to be able to more fully experience the views (and take countless screenshots).

The game really brings back some beautiful memories of some of my most beloved gaming experiences: Back when quests consisted of actually reading the items given to you and not just constantly following a quest marker. Having said that, I must admit that if it wasn't for the online wiki, there are a number of quests I would have never figured out how to continue. This is unfortunately in part to the open-world nature: Many quests are somewhat ""linear"" in that they continue from place to place along the path that the game may expect you to follow, however since you can decide, for the most part, to skip around areas or follow towards main opponents without checking every curve and corner, they are still very easy to overlook.

The characters, voice acting, and overall sound of the game are astounding. As someone who usually plays games for the gameplay and not the story, I found myself actually listening to the characters. I suppose it helps that the ""dialogue"" was short during each encounter, but it really added to the experience of the world, and in some cases, a true care for the characters.

I don't remember much from Dark Souls and haven't been keeping track of the other games to compare crafting and upgrading functionalities (where present), but I generally liked the approach here. What I somewhat disliked was the inability to use ""sword grease"" on the special weapons. I guess it makes sense, but I would have loved for it to still be possible, even if then tremendously nerfed, if nothing else then for the asthetic. :)

Despite my love for the game (not including multiplayer, which I am now starting on after getting all achievements), there are two very big annoyances:

1. Despite my fast computer and great graphics card, the game still crashes on a regular basis. When it doesn't crash completely, there are still significant stutters, that just so happen want to occur in the middle of boss fights or during plattforming, leaving me almost guaranteed to die.

2. Lack of ultrawide support: Part of the reason I didn't play multiplayer was because of the ultrawide fix requiring disabling anti-cheat and playing exclusively offline. This made the game absolutely beautiful and a treat to play, but it blows my mind how little effort From Software seems to put in their PC ports: That was the reason I haven't played anything since Dark Souls after switching to PC gaming, and it's depressing to see that it's still the case, despite the fact that the ultrawide fix (even if offline only) was made available practically instantly after the games release.

Aside from those major issues though, the game is tremendous and a lot of fun to play. It is so much fun to try new play styles and explore the game in a whole new way by searching for different talismans or focusing on incantations or sorceries over weapons, etc.";258.6;1.0;0.0;381.0;Posted: May 20

I don't know, just put Dark Souls 3 in an open world with some extra stuff and call it a day.

Elden Ring is a game where I am not exactly sure where I should put it when it comes to a rating of 1-10.
Regardless of what I think about it, I still enjoyed it and had a great time playing through it for the first time, but alas, my desire to replay it is non-existent. Once I got my final achievement to 100% it, I dropped it.
It has its upsides, and it's downsides, just like any other game ever made, and in this review, I will attempt to share my views and thoughts on it.


The Good

-There's a big world out there to explore, and as it's open-world, you have the freedom to explore on your own pace and go wherever you want. You can make it hard for yourself by rushing to the first boss you see and trying to fight it while likely under-leveled and under-geared, or you can stop to explore the world and come back to the boss once you've gotten some gear upgrades and level ups.
This allows each playthrough to be just a little big different depending on the paths you choose.

-Exploration is rewarded. There is a lot of different kinds of dungeons scattered around the world. They remind me a lot of dungeoneering from Runescape. You enter a dungeon, fight some monsters, solve some puzzles, fight a boss at the end and get loot. It's always interesting to find one and wonder what kind of loot you'll find.
There's also these smaller little dungeons that hold a chest inside but with no enemies, but these require you to have a key item which you can find while you explore the world or purchase from merchants.
It's pretty simple stuff, but it is a welcome addition regardless.

-Lots of weapon variety, allowing for lots of build variety. There's your basic weaponry which are still powerful and can be infused with the ashes of war to provide different weapon arts, and then there's your unique weaponry, powerful and equipped with their own unique weapon art.
It's really nothing new, other than for the ashes for war which I found to be a decent addition, but it is a plus regardless.

-Some interesting new mechanics. For example, the spirit summons are a cool, although somewhat controversial addition. Torrent, your steed, is there to make traversing the world less slow and painful, and there's even a crafting system that allows you to put some resources you gather to use.
You have new spells like the madness inflicting ones, and new ailments like the blackflame which saps away your opponents health for a short period of time.

-Cool bosses.
The satisfaction of beating a boss is still there, so if that's all you need from this game, go ahead and buy it.



-The world feels empty in some areas. For example, the lake by the academy is so barren that it's just a W key simulator. There's a reason you get fast traveling right from the get-go, otherwise it would be torturous.
Not to mention that often you wont even be able to fast travel since some random enemy you didn't even know existed within a kilometer radius somehow is in combat with you.

-Mostly pointless crafting system. In my over 100 hours put in the game, I never used the crafting system more than once, and I was only testing it out. It feels like an after thought to me, giving the player the ability to craft some basic consumable equipment out of scrap they'll find littering the game-world.

-Too many re-used bosses.
I read somewhere that there's about 120 bosses in the game. Now ask yourself and don't lie: How many of those do you think are unique rather than repeated bosses, different bosses mashed up together, gank bosses, or normal enemies made into bosses?
Not to mention the fact that the unique bosses seem to be designed around you using spirit summons, and purposefully delay their attacks so that learning their move-sets and timing is mandatory.

-Armor is still useless. It's just like Dark Souls 3, armor is there only for the looks, and barely makes a difference at all. Poise is still a broken mess, and the defenses and resistances just don't matter.
Your better off going naked into battle so you wont be getting heavy load.

-The traditional Dark Souls quest-design does not work well for this game.
In Dark Souls, you would likely come across the npc's naturally as you progressed since it was a more linear game, but since Elden Ring is an open-world game, the chances of you coming across that npc that you just talked to in the game world are very slim. Using Google is almost mandatory for this game if you want to do all the optional questlines.



I never played PvP so that's why I didn't mention it in my review.
I'd still recommend the game if you're an old fan of From, but if you're only just looking to get into the souls-franchise, I wouldn't recommend starting with this.
Dark Souls and Bloodborne are still my favorites in the From Software catalog.";109.3;1.0;0.0;107.0;Posted: May 22

Few things you should know before getting this. It punishes you mercilessly for mistakes. It rewards you just enough to keep you wanting to beat the crap out of that one thing you can't seem to beat... yet. The PVP that comes as part of asking a friend for help is so far beyond frustrating to those that don't want it that I have thought long and hard about how many times I want to punch the developers in the face. Those that are 'loyal' to the dark souls games appear to defend this. Personally, I @#&^ing hate it beyond all. So, be warned.
For reference though, I'm 390 (almost) hours into playing this, over and over, and yet I'm still staying strong.

Just to clarify this review may come off as negative because I only want to complain about the things that annoyed me or that I disliked. However in spite of that this game is definitely worth playing and has around 150 hours of content or more. This game is one of the only games where I actually want to look in every corner of the world, read every item description and discover the secrets behind the world. Discovery is one of the funnest parts about Elden Ring where every boss gives you a unique item and some of the areas you see are really interesting and beautiful.

Some combat additions they added that I liked a lot were the new crouch and jump attack, bringing back power stance weapons (although its automatic) and the ability to fight and travel on a horse.

Firstly I'd like to address a hopefully non-issue in the future, Computer Performance Issues.
Currently in the game I am still getting the occasional lag spike and choppy frames, this is not nearly as bad as how the game was first released however these issues still make boss fights incredibly annoying and frustrating at times since every second counts. I'm using an alienware m15 for reference so pretty decent specs.

----------------------------------- Potential Spoilers Below -----------------------------------
--| General Complaints

The swamps were really diverse with different colours, styles and Caelid was really cool however they were all mostly empty and had little reason to explore. Swamp of Aeonia you can just cheat your way though on a horse. Lake of rot looks amazing, however its completely devoid of content, there's no reason to stay there other than beating a repeat boss.

When killing a main boss instead of just fading away instead there should be a final critical hit. Almost every boss already has an inbuilt stagger/parry stun, it would be much better and realistic if we finished the boss with a critical hit.

There are few colossal sword options and they are just not really that viable.

You should be able to duplicate any remembrance at any walking mausoleum. There should also be another reason to knock down these walking castles.

There should be more caves and special areas, these areas should also be more diverse. Limgrave perfectly encapsulates this but as you continue through the game its like they forgot to add more content and make it unique. Its like they went from Limgrave to Raya Lucaria then to Caelid and so on until areas like consecrated snowfield which are gigantic empty plains in a sense. The fire giant mountain top is probably the worst case of this in the entire game. However this is only in terms of special areas to explore with unique items, pretty much every area is really well designed with beautiful sights and great use of elevation, it just needs to be filled better with more diverse enemies, etc.

There are incomplete npc questlines and cut npc quest content which are crucial for lore world building and hinting important areas of the map.


--| Npc Questlines

All npcs are interesting, well designed and unique, you want to interact with them however the game tries to make this as difficult as possible. It is basically impossible to finish npc questlines without a guide because npcs just randomly appear in different places without any hit or indication. Also npcs are still the same as other dark soul games they just stand in a specific spot and never move unless if they are hostile. Interacting with specific npcs will allow you to summon them to specific boss fights which is a really great feature however this should extend to them travelling the world with you.

Okay, now lets address the ♥♥♥♥ show which is Fia the Deathbed Companion, the Loathsome Dungeater and the Ever brilliant Goldmask. They are first introduced in the massive epic introduction at the start of the game and for each one you as the player interact with them and help them achieve their goals, which is tied to the Elden Ring and consequently the end of the game. Fia, Dungeater and Goldmask are great characters with great designs and dialogue however the only good/complete questline is Fias which feels fitting for the magnitude of her character. I will give a very high level summary just to show why her questline is fitting for her being an endgame npc. Essentially to complete her questline, you search for clues of death, go to the deepest part of the world, fight and defeat an ancient dark dragon and mend the rune of the deathbed prince. Meanwhile Dungeater's quest is just release him, to then kill him, feed him and hear him howl which is incredibly disturbing however unfitting of such a defiled, disgusting and infamous character. If Dungeaters quest is garbage I don't even know what to say about Goldmasks, the only notable thing about Goldmasks quest other than running across the entire continent is discovering a mystery which you solve using another npc (turtle pope). It shouldn't be more enjoyable reading people on reddit discuss their character then actually experience their questlines. And when you think it couldn't get any worse just watch the endings for each of them, complete disappointment, I discuss this further below.

You can go through a lot of trouble to save Melina by using the flame of frenzy and then Miquellas needle in the special area, but you will still never see Melina again which is kinda lame considering how there's no other reason to get flame of frenzy early in the game.

--| Elden Throne endings (Biggest letdown of the game)

At first the game had a lot of dialogue and npcs but slowly it just became another ds4. The endings for Elden Lord were especially disappointing, very lackluster and similar, like they could've at least had fia stand by your side as an apparition or melina after using miquellas needle. The only storytelling they did right was rannis questline where quest progression was clear and it unlocked new areas.

When interacting with the world NPCs ask you to become their champion, their elden lord and support their cause. You take allegiances with a side and progress their questline to get the ending they desire. However when you go through the trouble of completing their quest and reach their ending all you get is a lame cutscene which hardly shows the consequences of your actions or where the world is heading (and spoilers they all die, just cause, there's literally no one left who you supported). The endings could have been much better, its really a shame that so much potential for great characters like fia and dung eater was wasted. The endings should have been more unique like Ranni's or Frenzy Flame, seeing how the new ruling faction influences the world.
----------------------------------- Potential Spoilers Above -----------------------------------

In summary my main complaints are the npc questlines, elden throne endings and lacking diversity as the game progresses. They botched some great characters big time in my opinion.";151.9;1.0;0.0;91.0;Posted: May 20

Okay, first off, this game is extremely good. The world is immersive and deceptively deep, and the scale of this game is incredible. I don't just mean the size of the map, but the incredible versatility of the environments and the sheer mass of buildings and geography are intense to say the least. It looks beautiful and plays like a dream. The gameplay is extremely polished, and I don't think I've ever seen cleaner hit-boxes.

All that said, this game is in SERIOUS need of balancing. I'm nowhere near the end of the game, but I still get routinely 1/2-shotted by some bosses I'm definitely leveled enough for. I'm also in full heavy armor and using a shield with the Barricade Shield ability. Even so, you'd think I wasn't playing a tank based on how much damage I take. Quite frankly, it's absurd. It's not as if the game is too difficult, but rather that the game is far too punishing for the tiniest of mistakes.
This isn't a problem on all bosses though. Margit is a great example of a perfectly tuned and incredible fight, assuming you approach the encounter without grinding too much (or too early, for that matter). It's a fantastic skill check to see if you are ready for what the game has to offer.
Not all bosses are as well tuned as Margit though. If you want to make a game difficult, don't just crank up the damage the bosses deal and call it good. That's poor game design. A difficult encounter should push you to the limit of your skill and make you better at the game than you were before, not just stun combo you into oblivion if you dodge 0.00001 seconds too early. It feels really cheap sometimes.
I know this sort of critique is likely to licit 25 variations of ""git gud,"" but this is the one and ONLY problem I have with the game.
It's an astounding title and I can't wait to play it more, I just wish the difficulty was more rewarding to an increase in skill rather than level.";102.4;1.0;0.0;50.0;Posted: May 18

I think it's very good, but its like so unbalanced.
I keep getting stuck at places and I literally have to google to progress. ( like finding the key to the Raya Lucaria Academy was just... ) They're not very generous with the runes, some mobs in more difficult zones still gives 300 runes so I constantly feel like im underleveled and I feel like I have to find a cheese spot to grind on because just playing normally is not efficient at all. I also hate the tomb/dungeons with a passion. Absolute clown fiesta level design with the rolling traps. You can avoid them and progress for 10 min but if you ♥♥♥♥ up once you'll have to start all over again and jesus christ just give us a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoint like wtf.
Literally a running sim. I hate the boss draconic tree sentinel its so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unenjoyable to play against. I feel like a lot of bosses doesn't have telegraphed attacks and I feel like they did the progression so much better in DS3. This game makes me feel so wierd because I love it and hate it at the same time.

The VFX is really nice, magic looks super cool.
I've been doing the Ranni questline which has been pretty enjoyable and overall i've been enjoying the game.
But man some things are just super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unenjoyable and makes me want to play dark souls 3 instead.";54.3;1.0;0.0;81.0;Posted: May 19

Veteran Souls games player, this game meets up to its predecessors and more, giving a refreshing experience and a fantastic new world and lore to dive into while retaining and enhancing FromSoftware's game play formula.

Technically this should not be a recommendation but quite honestly i really think the game is beautiful and has some cool aspects to it however several of the mechanics in this game are GARBAGE. Certain bosses you fight 5 times and they use a set of a few moves, then randomly completely switch it up and go full rage mode mass spamming attacks like the devs couldn't come up with a better way to make boss fights harder and I don't mean phase changes i'm not an idiot. Some attacks are meant to be jumped yet hit you midair or are spammed 50 times in a row (Godfrey), while some bosses use certain attacks only 1 or 2 times the whole fight. DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW BAD THE HP/POISE SYSTEM IS! Multiplayer = nothing but glitches and idiots that looked everything up and took all of the fun out of finding ♥♥♥♥ for yourself so they could be ""good"" with no real skill. The multiplayer summon system is just broken and when you even can summon another player they get DC'd or can solo the boss themselves in 2 minutes flat (I have both the most stable and fast internet in my area so saying it's my internet is just stupid). The fan base is completely toxic or a bunch of new players that don't understand any of the most amazing parts of the souls/bloodborne/sekiro games let alone all the new stuff EldenRing brought to the whole grouping of games. Moral of the story if you are a masochistic freak like me then buy it immediately but if you are a casual gamer you have no right even bothering with this game sadly and i don't say that to be mean or put anyone down you just will not make it through this game without someone or the internet holding your hand because this game does NOT do it for you. All you people that say ""oh it's not that hard"" I mean great offence when I say you are just a ♥♥♥♥♥ that looked everything up, had your buddies carry you through every boss, or are extremely well versed in the games of the creator (only the toxic ones that think cause they play souls games they are superior gamers or some stupid ♥♥♥♥) and any of the above have no right commenting on this game because your opinion straight up doesn't matter. Please tell me i'm wrong I dare you, I'll fight the world on this IDGAF.";116.0;1.0;0.0;11.0;Posted: May 16

Have not been properly hooked to a game in literally over a decade. Now, finally, I am.

Funny is, I first torrented this game and started cheating, then purchased the game. I've also literally never done that.

I've also never wanted to completely get everything possible on the map, now I have.

This game is like when Dark Souls + Witcher made a baby.

All in all, I'm very surprised that I actually love this game, as I'm primarily been an MMO player.

I started this game off with the souls mentality, ""its just going to be a hard a** game that I wont even be able to pass the first enemy"". I am not going to lie, I HIGHLY encourage everyone reading this to buy it. That souls mentality sure its there heck people can say its even harder, but once you get the hang of the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ITS FUN, yeah you will die and everything but personally me, a FPS player, LOVES THIS GAME. I dont give these often but this game captivated me with its rewarding of so much pain and hard work. THIS GAME IS A 10/10 WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. The only few games that I've given this prior to this game are The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, Call of Duty Black Ops II, and Persona 5 Royal. (Hard critic; ofc this is my opinion). The games in my 10/10's are games that even if I played them and 100% them, I never grow tired of playing whats left, or just starting again. Truly and honestly I really, REALLY, recommend this game, whether you are a noob at the Soul's Born franchise like me, the game is a hell ton of fun, and trust me watch youtube videos and get to know the game, there are a vast catalog of videos that I found useful and fun. The game lets you play at your pace but if you are stuck I do recommend videos like this one for example: . There are multiple fun videos made for builds for your classes and everything is obtainable. The sky is the limit on what you can use in this game so give it a GOOD try spend a weekend if you have the chance playing the game. Trust me its a hell ton of fun!!!!!! Thanks for reading this have a fantastic day and take care (just know that this is my first review in a game so thats a way of noticing that this game is amazing! sorry for the grammar mistakes if theres any but have a amazing day)";173.9;1.0;0.0;38.0;Posted: May 16

Its a Souls game, but it is awesome. The open world experience felt not great at first, but it grew on me and I don't know if I would go back and play any of the other Souls games now.

Pros: Horse Mount, Ashes of war, Easy to respec, combat is fresh, game is gorgeous on max settings, native Xbox controller support(the only way to play on PC)

Cons: Online play can be laggy, still getting my ass handed to me over and over again

All in all, knowing there will likely be DLC on the horizon and I can still play through NG+ or make new characters to start over if I want is great. Game has a lot of longevity, just like the other Souls games. Worth the $60.";243.0;1.0;2.0;370.0;Posted: May 23

By far one of the best games I've ever played. Incredibly hard and incredibly fun, I felt that Elden Ring brought me some of the best times I've had while gaming in forever.

I am genuinely more impressed by this game than pretty much any game I've ever played. This is the first game in the Soulsborne franchise I've played, and I didn't expect it to be my type of game. But man everything about this game is perfectly crafted and engaging. The world is multiple times bigger and more detailed than anything I've seen, and it always stays interesting, fun, and worthwhile to explore. As Extra Punctuation said, Elden Ring lets its open world speak for itself. Beyond the world itself, the gameplay, progression, combat, bosses, character building, and general design/accessibility are all masterfully implemented and satisfying. There's so much meaningful depth and content that it's genuinely mind-blowing. Truly a masterpiece of gaming. Highly recommended, even if this type of game isn't generally your thing, this is a must-play.";58.6;1.0;0.0;314.0;Posted: May 22

This is my first From Software game, all the previous ones put me off with the brutal difficulty. Once I heard about the ability to level up your character by farming to make the bosses easier in this game it felt like the game for me. I am not a hardcore gamer in terms of skills, I normally hate boss battles, but have only been playing this a couple of days and have killed some mini bosses and am not far from killing the first major boss - not killed it yet, but the battle is the best boss battle I have ever played. I am using the Astrologer Mage class and the magic spells mean I can do a lot of damage from a distance which is making the game a lot easier for me.

The game is beautiful and atmospheric, you can tell a lot of love went into making it.

what can i say good about this game that hasn't been said already.

long story short, this game is the best i've ever played in years and i highly recommend it. i say this even if Elden Ring is my first souls-like game.

what i truly want to say is that I personally think the success of this game was needed at this point in our time. with all of the hype, this game was delivered as a finished product rather than something unfinished or unstable. so many big budget games these few years have released in a state that should be considered unsalable and sadly in so many cases unsalvageable. this has happened for so long that i fear our standards have lowered and become more accepting that any modern game shouldn't be expected to be finished on release. game's like Elden Ring prove that mindset wrong.

I hope Elden Rings' success reminds everyone the state a game should be in on release; finished, polished, and full of content.";282.6;1.0;0.0;22.0;Posted: May 17

I haven't been able to enjoy an RPG this much since the first Fable. So much is done right here, it makes your forgive the little things, the weird targeting, no quest tracker. Some might say it adds to the game, or makes it different, but I do miss it here. The combat is great, this is my first souls game, and I love this combat in an RPG. It's lots of fun and makes going into NG+ more fun since the combat will always remain engaging. The world is beautiful, it's not huge but it doesn't need to be since it's packed to the brim with content. The biggest downside to this game is the need to use a online guide when playing, at least if you want to know how to complete the quests, or track your progress.

Factor of Games [linktr.ee] Steam Deck Footage: https://youtu.be/vERdBnwMVSI

What can you say about Elden Ring that hasn't been said before? Nothing really, as the base has covered it to the nth level. I would say simply that the game takes the best of everything from the Bloodborne, Sekiro and the Souls series to deliver a solid game across the board. From Software left nothing on the table when they finished the game, and the final package is the culmination of all their learnings.

Regardless, if you play it on PC, PS4/PS5, Xbox platforms or even the Steam Deck (Link above to footage). Know that the current game runs amazingly well. Don't miss out!

Enjoy!

I've never been a big fan of open world games, but i do love a good old souls game. this meshes the two together perfectly. it's both the best, AND the worst souls type game i've played in a while. If you liked Dark Souls 3, this game is 100% for you. if you you like the idea of souls games but have a hard time getting into them, this game is good for you too, because unlike past souls games, it lets you set your own pace. just be prepared to take the time to grind. also side bosses are the way to level up. don't try to grind mob enemies. it's just slow.";224.5;1.0;2.0;91.0;Posted: May 20

I will say that I love this game, but I don't think this will be the Dark Souls Open World game that I wanted it to be. I will say that they absolutely nailed the PVE gameplay, customization, and variety in weapons. Their is so many things, and it took a lot longer to get them all in comparison to DS3. I could talk for hours about why the PVE is some of the series's best. But if you put hundreds of hours into DS3 after beating the story multiple times than this might not be the game for you. I put over 500 hours into DS3 and most of that was into PVP. Some of the best moments in my life was in DS3 PVP with my friends, and I have a really good life so that should tell you that it was really good. Elden Ring PVP is unbalanced and mostly unfun. The Spellslinger meta is garbage and unbalanced. I really hope major changes are made because I want this game to be my favorite like DS3 was";161.0;1.0;0.0;123.0;Posted: May 22

First of: Warning for players with AMD Graphic cards: the red lightning dragons can and most likely will crash your game. One solution seems to be to lower the graphics settings and try not to look at them (do not use lock on), use a summon and hope the enemy dies. Kind of ruins some of the bosses, unfortunately. Hopefully they will fix it at some point.

Apart from this: Its a fun game.
However, depending on the build you can have a drastically different experience and difficulty.
To make fights easier you can also use ash summons which is an interesting system, I think. You can find the summons spread out in the world and its fun finding new ones.

The levels and Legacy dungeons are fun, the open world looks gorgeous, but feels a bit stretched out at times.
Recycled enemies get kind of boring after some time. Unfortunately there are also a lot of identical looking dungeons (catacombs and caves). That kind of sucks, it doest take long to get tired of those layouts. also in late game caves previous bosses are used as normal enemies, which can get really annoying since they also have really big health pools and killing them isnt rewarding.

Enemies, especially later on, have very large health pools and deal insane amounts of damage, even with relatively high vigor (>50) you can only survive a hand full of hits from enemies. Especially annoying for the reskinned soldiers/knights. However with them you can at least guess they will be stronger if they have a new colour. There are several enemies, like crucible knights, that look identical, but have vastly different health pools, which can get frustrating if you can not properly anticipate their strength beforehand.

Still its a fun game, I wish it was less of an open world and more focused levels, since those tend to be the best and most interesting. Like Sormveil castle, the Academy or nokron eternal city.
Despite the problems you can have fun with the game and its easy to respec the character if you feel like your build doesnt work or you want to try something else. Also: Dont try to see everything in the first playthrough, I did this and all the identical catacombs with annoying enemies almost killed the game for me, just do what is fun to you. There is a NG system, so no need to 100% first playthrough.";181.8;1.0;0.0;369.0;Posted: May 20

Well, that is €59,99 well spent. I am in my NG+ (New Game Plus, like a second run) still enjoying every bit of it and doing some side quests I didn't know existed in my first run, cuz gamers, this game is massive. I believe I have passed 250 hours so far and probably gonna hit 300 no problem.

It really puts to shame other AAA games without the need of any DLC (can't wait) and without any in-game purchases of any kind. First game in my life that I carefully listened to every single dialogue (some several times) and check the internet to know about the lore and the many secrets it has. Weapons and builds to play the whole game 10 times with the addition of PvP.

Cons? Yep, The PC port is not optimized so to play Ultra Wide, uncap FPS or change FOV you will need to use third party software. I recommend Flawless Widescreen. Also, if you are like me and never played a Souls game, the first steps are gonna be tough. You will need to learn a lot of stuff by yourself because Mr. Miyazaki is not a fan of detailed tutorials or clear pointers. Again, it is hard at first, and some bosses (one in particular) incredibly challenging, but if you get through the first area I bet you will not be able to stop playing until the end.

A masterpiece like very few and maybe like no other.";271.5;1.0;1.0;103.0;Posted: May 19

All in all Dark souls Prepare to die edition is an amazing masterpeicec and i reccomend it to all who enjoy fantasy stories.

I don't use this word often for games, but Elden Ring is INCREDIBLE. For most open-world games, I find myself wandering around not doing much most of the time, but here, the world is so massive yet I can't stop finding things to do. The game's brutally challenging, but other than a few instances, it never feels like I've been cheated. It may not be the most graphically impressive game out there, the the art style is truly something to behold. The only real issues I have are the occasional stuttering issues where the game freezes for a second (which is distracting but not game breaking), a couple of cheap bosses, and a part later on where you're running through a maze of sewer pipes....that's pretty much it. I've never play anything from FromSoftware before, but this game made me an instant fan. I don't think this is just game-of-the-year material. Elden Ring is a game I'll be thinking about as one of my favorites of all time.";170.4;1.0;0.0;16.0;Posted: May 16

I have logged close to 2000 hours in the soulsborne games combined. This game was everything it needed to be: another souls game, and a big one at that. The game does give off a little bit of a Dark Souls 2 vibe where the flood of content can often cause repetitive content. However, in the midst of all the repetition is entirely unique and new ideas. The game feels like Dark Souls 3 mechanically and most certainly beats out its beauty and scale. I cant recommend this enough for new souls players to learn everything the genre has to offer.";84.4;1.0;0.0;49.0;Posted: May 20

Yea its pretty. Semi-decent combat. BUT, this game has dropped the ball and catered to a very niche market of players that spend their life playing hard AF games I guess.

Since there's no neutral option I'm going with neg to point out some of the games flaws. Some of what I say may have spoilers, but I'll try not to add any. Overall I enjoy the game and will continue to play it off and on, but this is definitely the weakest souls game From Software has made in my opinion.

The game is well made, it's solid, but it's the jankiest of any FS souls game I've played, has multiple glitches, and the open world mechanics clash and weaken what I personally like about the souls games, like a sense of achievement or reward. I went through my first time cold, then my second time with a guide to comb through. I've been through a third since then, and I've tried out about 2 builds per char.

-Tons of glitches and crashes, on PC at least. Summoning errors that have not been corrected since launch that only seem to effect a certain group of people (https://tinyurl.com/42rhh6nt) Body/rune recovery glitches, broken quests (still) inaccurate stat scaling on multiple accounts (some fixed) Getting attacked through walls is way worse than it's ever been before - enemies and bosses read inputs as a cheap mechanism to kill you.

-Overall I died more in this game to being overrun with surprise enemies than in any other souls game - being jumped and surrounded and stun locked seems to be the main thing in this game. As long as you are patient and use target lock there's not much of a challenge outside of a boss room or two.

-as for BOSSES - so many are reused it's sad. some of the main bosses are re-used over and over again in the open world dungeons, which are quite often the same layout, and just feel like weak busy work and excuses to kill time. Most can be completed in less than 10 minutes. a couple few may give you a challenge and last 30.

-about QUESTS, that obscure souls quest system was fun and great in the more funneled design of the previous souls games. Having NPCS randomly move around such a large open world makes some quests impossible to understand without a guide.

-While a a previous Dark Souls game may offer you multiple paths to take, you'd always inevitably hit a boss you need to handle, sometimes leaving you stuck between a rock and a hard place until you figured it out. The sense of accomplishment from this situation is gone, since now you can run around the open world and level and gear to your hearts content. Without killing the first MINI boss, you can comb every single area of the game minus a small handful of end game areas, which only require 2 boss kills. The result is a lot of well geared invaders at lower levels stomping people. There's also no level cap on weapon buffs like the old games, so a level 5 char can rock an end game +25 sword and invade your beginning char. This could happen in previous souls games, but it took skill to pass the boss gates at the low levels to get that gear to invade. Not anymore.

-The lack of design in the open world can be plainly seen, and is mostly there as a huge time waster. There's not much reason to the day/night cycle besides some hidden bosses and some enemies may drop a small amount more of runes. The stealth mechanics are laughably OP and the AI is totally blind making free stealth damage a constant no matter what your build. A lot off items I'd usually just be able to buy from a vendor over and over with souls/runes are now replaced with crafting system crap I need to waste time to farm up instead. If you get invaded in the open world might as well just sit and wait for 5 minutes for the idiot to come running towards you lol. Just a lot of weakness in what I was expecting to be tighter gameplay.

Overall this game is the worst where it strays from it's traditional design, the open world is weak, almost everything about it is a boring addition, or weakens the strength of the souls formula, I think it's a good first attempt, but my hope in the future is they do more legacy type areas and far less open world areas, the lack of having a funneled design in a lot of the open worlds places makes it weak, exploitable, and overall less enjoyable.";243.0;0.0;2.0;313.0;Posted: May 22

TLDR: Search on youtube ""let me solo her Malena"". That's the game in a nut shell. If you like what you see then you will enjoy this game (controller is a must however).

Kind of a 3D Mortal Combat arcade fighting game (extensive twitch muscle memory when mashing buttons is a must) with very light RPG elements and lots of exploration (this is were the Asian culture of the developer comes out) though very much of it is repetitive. It's essentially a console game that works quite poorly on PC (don't even attempt using a keyboard and mouse - as a matter of fact the game's input tool-tips by default assume you are using a controller).

The combat has a bunch of contrived mechanics slapped together that are probably in place to account for the limitations of a console controller (can't control vision and also hit XYBA buttons at the same time - I am using a steam controller - etc.). As a side note, I don't play console games because I find the controllers subpar compared to a keyboard and mouse.

Veterans of PC FPS games are REALLY going to struggle with the camera movement, the controls and the combat mechanics. Be prepared to forget everything you know and learn something you will only use in the ""FromSoft"" games. There's nothing else quite like it on the PC market and that's probably for a very good reason.
You got stuff like rolling (dodging) into mob abilities and take no damage as long as you do it at the right time (they call this immunity frames), you can jump to avoid some ground aoe (even though the particle effects clearly engulf you visually) and so on. In addition there's some very sadistic input requirements some are just stupid some are likely driven by the use of the controller. For example to dodge in a specific direction you have to hold down the direction button for at least a second BEFORE pressing the dodge button, and to run you have to press and hold the dodge button for at least a second - all this in a game were dodging/sprinting in the right direction at the right millisecond is vital. I thought maybe they are trying to simulate inertia and mass, but that's not the case as you (and mobs) can do a 180 turn on a pin head when rolling or running when using the mouse.
And then there is dodging. Lots of It as Boss combos can be very long (6-7 moves or more). This game should really be called Elden Dodge. Yes there's stuff like parry and blocking but their usage is extremely limited when fighting a boss (again mainly because of the length of the combos). A boss fight consists of 3-4, up to 8 or even more consecutive very well timed dodges followed by one swing. Rinse and repeat until boss is dead.

Regarding RPG, there is essentially no character customization in terms of stats. As a matter of fact it really doesn't matter what class you start with as they will end up identical if/when you max all their stats. Spells, weapons and armor cannot be customized in any way (you do have 5-6 types of arrow damage and more arrows that do same type of damage just more of it). Weapons can be upgraded (it's a straight forward damage buff) and can be tweaked with abilities (called ashes of war). There are lots of weapons but for the most part only a handful of classes (15 weapon classes or so?). The class gives the weapon it's move set (what it does when you swing it). Each weapon can have up to 1 ability. Most do come with one. An ash of war allows you to change that one ability and also change the damage type (and the stat with which the damage scales, but it's not really important).

Quests are limited (this is no way an Elder Scrolls Game). The story and characters are very Asian. The lore is definitely something to behold as GRR Martin (he got hired for this game) is a master lore builder, but a complete failure when it comes to story telling (that's why he keeps killing all his characters in his books, because he can't tell a story to save his life and he needs to make room for new characters and the lore surrounding them).

There is a lot of fake hype surrounding this game. Going in I heard stuff like ""best mounted combat in any game ever"" etc. Don't be mistaken, this game's combat mechanics cannot begin to compare with stuff you find in titles like ""For Honor"" or ""Mount & Blade"". And what it has is weird, contrived, awkward, going into a direction all of its own. And just another example of how awful and contrived the controls of this game are (again probably driven by the fact that the input scheme is designed for a console controller): You cannot turn your mount around AND stand put in a given spot (say atop a cliff). Not with your normal controls. You CAN do it IF you use an item (looking glass) which provides zoom vision. In an exploration game... where cliffs and falling are an important mechanics.";45.6;0.0;1.0;99.0;Posted: May 21

Felt shallow and lazy compared to previous games, and the news systems detract from the game more than add. Most ash of wars are just plain inferior to anything else you can choose in almost every circumstance available to the point where over half are completely worthless to everyone at all times. They buffed and expanded bleeding to the point where its all that is used in pvp and just silently slid magic in all forms into the trashcan. Bows and crossbows still exist but both types are completely worthless past the very start of the game, and then we get into the dozens of bosses that are exactly the same as the previous one but with a different skin and a new attack or two. This isn't just bosses though, elden ring re uses regular enemies too such a degree that there is hardly more than 5 types in the entire game that can be compared to their almost the same cousins. Its also open world... except its not really, too get any sort of even partial completion of any npc questline or even access to the basic systems of the game you either have too look it up, get lucky, or just accept that you will have nothing but bad endings and halfways done npc storylines. A clothing system exists that hardly does anything at all, the summon and horse system are solo only and completely unavailable in multiplayer. This game pretty much tops being the worst in the history of its genre because its made by a big company and has good graphics... because thats all it has, the recognition of being made by a big company and shiny colors, thats it. How this game wasn't completely destroyed by the entire fanbase for its complete and utter lack of uniqueness and follow through I will never know.";139.8;0.0;2.0;252.0;Posted: May 23

So this is a full priced AAA 2022 game which has:

* PC controls which would not be considered acceptable even in the 1980s. (Even though you can rebind the keys, this game was designed exclusively for a PS controller, not a mouse/keyboard - so for instance, the F key by default jumps - because that's how insane the PC controls are.)

* UI design which would also not be considered be acceptable even in the 1990s

* Loading screen which shows a message box you have to click ""Accept"" on every time you go to the main menu. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

* Graphics which would be considered cutting edge back in 2006.

* A story, but not one which you can actually follow. I finished it and as far as I can tell there's a ring (maybe? it's in the title of the game - but never seen it) and eventually <spoiler>you kill the ruler/god of the land and I guess that means you're in charge?</spoiler> I don't think I finished a single NPC's questline - and there were about 50 of them. I mean you could if you really, really wanted, but you'd have to Google how to do it and then follow the instructions exactly - if you deviate, the questline just ends - with no notification whatsoever. While there is a map (thank god - the world is huge), only < 1% of the questlines actually put locations that you're supposed to go to on this map - to the extent that if you see a location marked on your map - you think it's a bug.

* Intentionally annoying level design - which just consumes your time - but neither adds difficulty nor is fun. (You will die 500ish times in the course of playing this game - and each time, you'll burn about 10s on a loading screen, and then 20s-120s just running back to start the boss fight again). So that's about 20h of your life wasted.

I've played what I consider to be a decent amount of the game. Got about as far as Leyndell before deciding I'd had enough of the nonsense. Elden Ring is far and away from being a good game. A beautiful-yet-boring world stuffed with repetitive filler to make the game look like there's a lot of content when really it's just copy/pasted enemies filling in a pretty backdrop. No joke, that's all you do: run around a big empty world and kill enemies and even bigger enemies. Oh, and die a lot.

Yes, this game is difficult. Yes, I went into this knowing that FromSoftware games are notoriously hard. I didn't think I'd mind that because I love a good challenge. But there's a HUGE different between being difficult and being straight-up immersion-breaking. And Elden Ring is a whole lot of the latter. Enemies and bosses can one- or two-shot you even if you've leveled up a significant amount. Even if you've gotten better weapons or upgraded your existing ones. Even if you went and found an NPC or Ashes of War or even another player to summon to your aid. No matter how many hours you spend grinding runes. No matter how many times you try to parry or dodge or heal or even cheese, all of which are at many times impossible to do because the enemies and bosses are just too fast and too unpredictable. At some point they've killed you so many times that it becomes more of a chore than a game.

And then there's the storytelling, which in and of itself is virtually nonexistent and should more or less be labeled ""loreytelling"". There's a ton of exposition in the beginning cutscene, and then you're just told to go become Elden Lord. No reason why, just go do it because that's the game. But beyond that, there's no unfolding, driven narrative. No characters worth giving a crap about. No plot twists or emotional moments or anything that makes the player WANT to continue. All there is is worldbuilding and an egregious amount of it that most people will probably miss. The game doesn't even tell you what the purpose of any of this is. WHY do I need to claim the title of Elden Lord? WHY is the Erdtree important and not simply the biggest freaking MacGuffin I've ever laid eyes on? WHAT is the point?

I don't particularly care what excuses anyone has defending this game's insulting lack of story. Lore and story are two very different things, not interchangeable synonyms. If Elden Ring were a novel, it'd be one of the worst-written novels I've ever heard of.

The last major issue I have with this game is the dungeon design. Maybe I'm spoiled by the dungeons of Zelda, but these ""dungeons"" are little more than fortresses filled with a ton of enemies and little else. Whether it's the big main dungeons or the smaller castles or even the stuff underground, everything is routinely the same. The big dungeons at least have different visual appearances to them, but there's so few of them compared to the tons of copy-pasted smaller dungeons that it almost doesn't matter. None of these dungeons are memorable in any sense of the word.

The only real aspects of Elden Ring that I can confidently consider pros are the gorgeous graphics and the stellar soundtrack. If even half as much effort went into making the rest of the game that good, I wouldn't be as upset at it. But in no conceivable way can I recommend this game. It just does not live up to the hype surrounding it.";40.2;0.0;2.0;101.0;Posted: May 23

As a person who very much enjoys Souls games, I don't feel like Fromsoft really care about balancing their game. You just simply can't find good pvp match ups anymore in invasions and everyone just uses one-shot builds. But to make matters worse, the servers for Elden Ring are completely garbage and you can't go an hour without being disconnected from your friends unlike in the Dark Souls titles. The actual pve of Elden Ring is incredibly easy and playing the game feels somewhat like a step down from what they had done in Dark Souls 3.

Beautifully designed world and lore, occasionally fun PVE, but overall the game suffers from extreme repetitiveness. The exploration gets very tedious at times due to how vast the open world is. As for the multiplayer aspects, don't even get me started. The game suffers from constant player disconnects, crashes, laggy connections (that weren't nearly as bad in previous From games).

I've played and beaten all the Dark Souls games and Bloodborne, but I had a bad feeling about this game since I played the beta in November. It's a mediocre RPG, if you want to call it that. The exploration is bland (it was fun at first but became increasingly more of a chore). Strange - most games simply cannot nail exploration, yet it's a bit of surprise this one couldn't. The combat is pretty good - significantly better than DS3, although not as good as DS2 or 1. The graphics are far too green, and they do this trick wherein some places look extremely nice, like Stormveil, but other places look like trash. I've noticed that some games do this and it's a little confusing on the eyes. Like in some areas Fallout 4 looked excellent, and in others it looked like mud. The quests are dull and mysterious to the point in which they become uninteresting. One problem that I really have with the game as well is that for a large number of the items you need to do research on how exactly to get them. In DS2 I randomly came upon Havel's armor and used it for the rest of the game, along with the Mammoth sword. No research necessary. Elden Ring isn't trash, although it is a disappointment. I'd say DS2 is best (lol unpopular view), then DS1, Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and then DS3.";64.0;0.0;1.0;43.0;Posted: May 21

IF you like playing with Mouse and Keyboard, this game is not for you

This game is clearly designed with an X-Box type controller in mind. Even choosing my character type was frustrating as there was no indication what keyboard or mouse key I should press. The game ran smooth and the graphics looked beautiful, but having grown up playing WOW and similar games on PC, not in the mood to have to be forced to use a controller. Sure you can bind all the button you wish you your keyboard, but then the tutorials keep saying press the Y button to read, A button etc... I refunded it.

I love this game a ton and I've barely poured any time into it. Its the first from software game i wanted to play but oh my dear sweet god is that multiplayer busted into oblivion. From Software thought that instead of making enemies tougher in coop, they'd rather offer rewards to players for being douche bags and killing people. Because all you're doing is enticing people to ruin others' fun for no reason. If this is absolutely necessary then make a mode for people who like getting invaded and see how many people play it. People enjoy these games for the challenge but i think most of us can agree the invasion system should be able to be toggled on and off. This game is fantastic but please my friend and I will be having a blast with the challenge and the adventure then we get invaded by some meta weeaboo and just like that we both are miserable and quit out of the game as it ruins all the fun.

I wish I could put a 'maybe' recommendation. My issue is that the game mainly uses one CPU core, so even if your CPU does great with other modern games that use multi-threading, it may not be enough for this poorly optimized PC port. However, other than low FPS caused by the avoidable bottleneck, I didn't have any noticeable glitches or stutters, and the first hour or so was fun.

Now listen, I may be screaming into the wind for no reason. But I cannot deal with this game. From the constant lag spikes (FYI, my hardware is not the issue. I can play Witcher 3 on mostly best settings and get 60 FPS from it, meanwhile I still got constant lag spikes on this with all settings on lowest) and the story making nearly no sense along with the Sekiro-like difficulty, I refuse.

Best way I can describe this is they took the boss difficulty of Sekiro and threw it into Dark Souls and it just doesn't mesh well at all. Some bosses like Godrick were a joke, while Margit was extremely tough. I lost my will to play this when I got to the Leonine Misbegotten & Crucible Knight duo-boss, failed a ♥♥♥♥-ton of times, finally beat it only to be told I wasted my time and I can't get to Radahn. As I thought: Closer to beginning of game = easier areas. But nope.

As for the story? I've tried to get into it and understand it, but it just doesn't click well with me at all. I may be missing things but it mostly seems like the writer was a senile man they hired and only kept his story due to some type of sunk cost fallacy. Cause I really don't get it after researching for around 3 hours in some vain attempt to like the game. And most of what I've seen are people insisting the game is clever and interesting, yet if you think about it then it really doesn't work. So this is basically Bioshock Infinite all over again.

I wanted a Dark Souls 4 (spiritually), instead I got Sekiro 1.5. And I already wasn't very fond of Sekiro.
And before you say ""Git gud"", I've beaten all three Dark Souls several times and beaten Demon Souls once. If I gave up on this game, something's definitely wrong. Sure, it's not impossible but I don't wanna devote time to trying to beat this when my playing experience so far has been more miserable than all three Dark Souls games combined.";60.5;0.0;5.0;243.0;Posted: May 17

Honestly not that fun on PC. Great reviews so I was excited to play this game. I enjoy the challenging nature of the fights. It's obvious that an incredible amount of care and attention has gone into making this game, which I appreciate. But a few choices make it kind of irritating. I never know what the heck I'm supposed to do. Many other large, open world games have some kind of quest tracking system, typically integrated with the map. I've got over 30 hours into the game and I don't know if I'm working toward the main story or not. The artwork is intricate and highly stylized, but seems too whimsical for me. Everything has a fairy tale, dreamlike quality. It's also clearly designed for consoles. I purchased the steam version for PC and literally wasn't able to get through character creation since by default all the controls are for console. I needed to Google instructions to change the defaults to use keyboard and mouse. Is it so hard for the devs to make the PC version default to using PC for input? It seems more like the game designers just don't care about the player's convenience or happiness. The quick slot system makes it very hard on PC to change between for example sometimes using a bow and sometimes using a sword and shield combo. Finally there's no way to pause the game. If you're playing, I hope you don't get a phone call or have a roommate or child that needs help, because your character will just die since you cannot pause. Why? Maybe I'll try to load up some mods to make it more user friendly for PC... For reference, I have not played Darksouls or any other FromSoftware games, so maybe I'm struggling with a one-time learning curve. Other games I like include the Witcher Series, Assassin's Creed series, Elder Scrolls series, particularly Skyrim which is probably my favorite game.

Hey, do you play souls games? You'll love everything about Elden Ring, from the bosses to the playerbase.

Dont play souls games and wanted to give them a try? Don't! The bosses in the game pretty much will own your hide no matter what you try. Want to level up to trying and get stronger to beat a boss? Good luck grinding for days to scrounge enough runes for 1 level after they start reaching 100k per lvl. Or just do like everyone else and grind exploits until the same problem occurs.
Oh, but you think that maybe the community will help you find a build that fits your play style or give help of a boss? Well, aside from every boss being an input reading Ai with a penchant for repeatedly smashing you with the same ability endlessly, whatever advice given will typically be null and void from that fact as well, oh and don't forget to sprinkle some of that GIT GUD stuff on there, the community loves spewing that at anyone who dares suggest a slightly toned down difficulty, its not like you have a life outside the game.

Tldr, ignoring all the rage up above, the game is fun in the open world, but really, don't bother if you want to complete the story, every boss is just a headache that no matter your skill(unless your a sweat) will find some way to piss you off before you kill it.";200.5;0.0;4.0;70.0;Posted: May 19

I want to love this game but it has some very glaring issues that make me unable to recommend it. The boss design is terrible, some of the worst in any game I've played ranging from bosses that do extremely long, almost impossible to avoid combos that end in delayed AoEs so melee players can't get in, or the boss will fly completely across a huge map constantly so you're chasing and dodging for an eternity hoping to get 1 hit in or the boss is made that you can only attack if you take damage but all the bosses hit like a nuke, even with full vigor most bosses can take half your health in 1 hit, but ranged players aren't home free either, there are bosses that are completely resistant to magic, story bosses that are immune or heal from things like holy damage so if you tried to make a faith build around holy damaging weapons or spells, your journey ends here because that story boss is completely immune to you and the fight would be hard already for a build that can actually damage it with their best stuff. The worst part is, the worst offenders of the bad design issue are mandatory story bosses, like a certain someone who's name rhymes with Margaret or the star that shall not be named, if you played the game more than a few hours you know. There are also lots of dungeons that lock you in with no way to get out but fighting, no indication on the level or anything so exploring, it is entirely possible to end up stuck somewhere with no way to get out because you're not strong enough to fight, including a trap right in the starting area that could very easily have you stuck if you don't know the path to get out. then you add in bad patches where they remove access to upgrades or things that just made certain mandatory encounters manageable on all builds while leaving in extremely bad things that some bosses can do that they very clearly shouldn't and the community complains about nonstop, or things like PvP that is awful and you're left with a fun but fatally flawed game. It has a lot of good but when the worst part of a Souls game is the bosses, there is a big issue.";152.4;0.0;3.0;8.0;Posted: May 17

When you spend a lot of money it is always a worry if the game is going to be good especially if refund is not an option. Will the game hook you and make you want to play, will you get the ""yes this is gona be good!!!"" feeling ""I'm glad I paid this much"" or will it not and sit on your shelf collecting dust? I've played 0.6hrs at time of review and it is not looking good. If a game goes not hook me from the start and give me that feeling i'm too old to bother with it. Entertainment should not be a chore I have to work for in the hope of maybe I will be entertained at a later date..

The game intro is a series of 2d still drawing with voiceover. There are lots of words and images that mean nothing, are nonsensical, explain nothing and do absolutely nothing to hook you and get you pumped for the game. The only reason I can come up with is if someone thought this was a way to create mystery, is a drunk guys rambles mysterious er no. If this was the aim they should have just started the game, no intro just dump you in the world, that would create some mystery. Or get someone with some talent in to make a good intro.

Ok you start the game and by now some voiceover has said you want to find this ring. I don't know who I am or why I want it, no back story nothing, how do I know I even want it? Who knows maybe a guy in a pub said it would look nice on me. Saying my character wants something with no context is not mystery guys it is just dumb.

You find messages str8 away everywhere that mean nothing and are nonsensical, explain nothing and do absolutely nothing to hook you. You find a finger that explains you can use that to write messages for other players to see. So all these messages on the floor everywhere are just rubbish other players have written. Next step start googling how to turn that off. Everyone just loves having to google settings a few mins into a game right, getting soo hooked now guys well done.

This game is meant to be good. If I can be bothered to force myself to play more and find that out and can get over the terrible terrible terrible start I will change my review.";1.4;0.0;1.0;133.0;Posted: May 22

Before you get mad, I genuinely wanted to like this game. I wanted to throw myself into it and go all in. I didn't play Dark Souls so I wasn't so impressed by the clunky mechanics. There are barely PC setting for the keyboard layout and the gamepad only seems to support XBox controller display.
The artwork in the cut scenes and story narration were great. I normally don't have the attention span for cinematics but these were worthy and pleasing.
Character creation sucks. Not good. Terrible presets. Awful customization. If you don't care about that you should be fine. Every person you chose no matter what you do, you end up looking like a potato head. No thanks.
Not a true open world RPG. No NPCs or towns. So weak.
Who ever stated that this was the game of the year must be new to video games.
Very 2016 IMO.
I should have trusted my instinct and waited until it was on sale for $19.99. Even Cyberpunk wasn't this bad and Cyberpunk launch was a disaster.
I would say that it could get better in a year or two but I doubt it will, unless they redo the entire game.
On the other hand, Elden Ring made me appreciate my other games more.

Do not buy this game. Do not support FromSoftware's PC endeavors.

You can check my profile. I have over 800 hours of DS1, and over 800 hours of DS2 between base and SotFS. I have over 300 hours of DS3. I have played the Souls games.

I played the OG PC launch of DS1 where I had to download and tinker with mods just to get my mice to work, and unlocking the framerate meant you could slide down ladders and out of the world.

This is the BEST Souls game yet. Character customization is bomb, level design is bomb, story is bomb, weapons are cool. Sure, PVP is all Ashes damage and memes, and fundamentally kind of worse than the other Souls games, but I can forgive it.

What I cannot forgive is the absolute trash tier optimization, and port of this game. I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 7700K, both with mild overclocks and appropriate cooling, and the vast majority of my parts are bog standard safe, tried and true. I have NO issues in any other games, and I play Warframe at 1760p (Downsampling, don't ask) and get around 120 FPS.

How is there no widescreen support? How is there no unlocked FPS? How is it that I have to verify my game files every time that I launch the game? How does this game crash my WHOLE computer, no blue screen? How many fixes do I have to make? I spend about an hour of maintenance for every 10 hours of game play, maybe more. I have had 6 save file corrupts, and thankfully I know enough about hex editing to fix that, but not everyone does. Look at my hours in this game, that is all you need to know that this negative review is PURELY from their garbage optimization.

If you think I got some detail wrong, feel free to inform me so. Now to the review.


This game is a waste of potential. It takes the fantastic concept of challenging bosses that make you feel godly and are extremely rewarding upon their defeat and removes the ""make you feel godly part"". Ill compare this to hollow knight(Hence, spoilers for hollow knight ahead) since these 2 games share some very similar ending sequences: Radagon-Elden Beast and Hollow Knight-Radiance

In Elden ring, you first have to fight a stupidly unbalanced boss that will hit you with carbon molecules he exhaled from his ass before being able to fight a boss that will keep a distance of 9 marathons from you all while spamming so many projectiles you forget what a projectile even is. Whenever you die you have to go through the stupidly unbalanced boss every time, effectively draining everything you have-potions, summons, you name it, before putting you in another fight.
Now the game I draw comparison to: Hollow Knight. In it, you follow a very similar formula: fight a boss to reach the other one, have to refight the entrance boss every time you die. Now here is the magic of hollow knight: the fight isnt overly challenging in comparison to other fights in the game. The fight is actually very well balanced-all the attacks are perfectly manageable(Im looking at you, Radagon's 10 mile long hammer slam hit-you-with-his-ass hitboxes). Beyond that, Hollow Knight, too, has an invincibility-roll kind of mechanic with it's dashes at that point in the game. So what makes the fight different? Literally everything. Hollow Knight is there(in my opinion, I know a lot of people see it as a big flaw) to make YOU feel hollow. The fight is simple-its just a gate to get to the final boss. If you die to the final boss once, it feels like a punishment, after all, chances are, you got your ass kicked into nothing by the Hollow Knight, but you get progressively better and better at it to the point where you feel like a god, until eventually you fight him so many times the feeling fades away and you are fully focused on defeating radiance, at which point it is you successfully ""contain"" it. Now what happens in Elden Ring in the same exact scenario: you are alive by a single strand of hp with 4 potions as you go into the final boss, you die. You then die to Radagon 7 more times before getting to the boss again, you die. You eventually get good enough where you beat him consistently but it kind of stops there for your average Joe. You get your ass kicked over and over and over. If this is a roleplaying game the role you are playing is the victim of abuse. When I finally defeated the Elden Beast I didnt get a feeling of ""HELL YEAH FINALLY"" like I did with the radiance, rather it was ""finally this fat ♥♥♥♥ is dead"". It felt like a burden. In case you cant see the issue here-Hollow Knight(the boss, not the game itself) was BUILT to be a burden and yet felt 10x less of a burden than whatever the hell Elden Ring has going. And dont even get me started on how bleed-a whole major build type-was disabled in its entirety on the fight. I could draw many more similar examples-Malenia and Mantis lords(both fast paced and very punishing fights) for example. And don't even get me started on the quests here. They are so horrible they dont deserve to be spoken of. Basically the main issue is how unbalanced boss battles are(took the challenging for the sake of challenging path instead of challenging for the sake of rewarding path)

Its a shame. Literally everything other than the things I talked of has been done perfectly.
Also, if anyone thinks I should just ""get gud"", I have 112% in hollow knight and 100% in Celeste and has beaten a countless amount of undertale fangames(which have quite an infamy for their difficulty), I do know quite a bit in terms of fun challenges.";62.6;0.0;2.0;25.0;Posted: May 16

The game gets very annoying after a while, which is compounded by the fact that you can't quit to desktop.
Quit brings you back to the main menu, with a text pop up you need to close; all before you can scroll down and quit. Controls are clunky in the sense that multi-key registry appears to be almost non-existent. I find myself desperately mashing the button to heal, but unable to do so because I'm still walking backwards or something. It doesn't do it every time either, which makes it that much more annoying.

I'm still going to play it, I guess. I must hate myself or something.

Sure would be nice if they put a little more effort into making this a PC game though. Quit to desktop is some pretty basic stuff. Sometimes I alt-f4 and don't even care about the consequences though--this is that type of game.";24.7;0.0;1.0;75.0;Posted: May 20

I respect the business practices and all the art that went into this game. I think there are truly excellent parts. It's very repetitive, the bosses are mostly unremarkable or unfair or simply annoying and the RPG elements are weaker than they've been in a Souls game in years. I can't recommend this game because it didn't make me feel anything new and was boring or annoying for the vast majority of the runtime.

For example, there are so many dungeons smattered throughout the world that are caves, catacombs, mines, etc. There are a few truly special ones, but once you've beaten one of the generic ones, you've beaten all of them. This system feels significantly worse than the much maligned chalice dungeons. Since the dungeons in Elden Ring are finite, I felt a desire or hope to find something really interesting and unique in them. Instead, they generally provide summons or weapons that were almost always useless. Without any extrinsic benefit, you'd hope that they'd be fun. Unfortunately, none of the dungeons provide satisfying puzzles and many of the bosses are just regular enemies from elsewhere put with a big health bar. Chalice dungeons had unique and good bosses, extrinsic benefits that couldn't be gotten anywhere else, and were a good mix of repetitive and challenging. This new dungeon system is a step backwards in most ways.

That's just one area of this game that really shows its weaknesses. There's too much content with a lack of originality and specialness. There's so much good here spread out with long open plains and peppered with crap to fill the world. Compared with the games from Ubisoft and their ilk, this is a triumph with commendable business practices and tons of wonderful elements. I think FromSoftware has released significantly better games in the past (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne and Sekiro especially). You could probably play at least 2 or 3 of those in the time it'll take you for your first playthrough of Elden Ring. I highly recommend doing that instead.";96.8;0.0;2.0;72.0;Posted: May 17

There is an intended delay input that ruins your roll timing. Can't enjoy this game because of it. Go back and play Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro and see if you feel as much delay as Elden Ring have. FromSoftware wants to the make the game artificially hard but does this instead of making well designed difficult bosses like Slave Knight Gael. And no there is no controller delay input or pressed but not let go because there is no controller at all. Ive been playing with keyboard only from Dark Souls 1, quick tap space every time to roll. And my PC specs are RTX 3060 TI, Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB RAM. So my PC isn't giving me delay, neither are my keyboard. I am done with this game because of it, I refuse to play a scared ranged magic build running around and gunning every boss down like the rest of these players. I want to run in there with no shield but a sword and roll dodge everything, and while i've learned the patterns, i simply can't react in time because the delay input is too long. Why do you have the boss attack so bloody fast when you implement a roll input delay? It just doesn't make any sense. Fix this and ill overlook the terrible open world, terrible difficulty balance, the endless repetition of the bosses, the overkill moveset the bosses throw at you, the lame NPCs storyline, the non-existent maiden, the lame story, and the fact that it is not even close to how amazing Dark Souls 3 boss designs were. I mean at this point I rather fight Gael than all of the bosses combined in Elden Ring.";71.1;0.0;1.0;31.0;Posted: May 21

CPU runs it at only 45-59% so it's not a bottleneck issue, my GPU works on every other game in my library. 2nd half of game is just boring minus some boss fights. It's not the worst game gameplay wise, but definitely not as good as DES, DS1,DS2,DS3,BB, and Sekiro so play those instead (If they ever fix the online, but they prob wont for a while because they are devoting all dev time to Elden Ring)";91.7;0.0;0.0;303.0;Posted: May 21

It’s no secret that Elden Ring has gained A LOT of praise. Besides the buggy launch with performance issues (welcome to the gaming industry for the last 15 years), most people have only great things to say about it. I’m more in the mixed camp.

For the first time in the Souls series from Software, it’s fun to use mage build. It’s VERY flexible and you have so many spells (if you can find them) to play around with. The Spirits is also a good addition if you lack co-op help.

Now, while I do enjoy most of the game I also have gripes with it. But none of it makes it a silly super low score.

The technical stuff:

The Easy Anti Cheat is really pointless and network stability when doing invading or co-op is unstable. Somehow this has gotten worse since Dark Souls 3. Which is weird. I do hope FromSoftware does a better job on online play in the future because it REALLY needs work. Framerate is still unstable and I’m sure if it’s the old game engine or the damn awful AC implementation used.

Gameplay and map:

I know OPEN WORLD is very popular. Sadly Elden Ring’s map feels more like something from a Ubisoft game. By the end, you have so many icons on the map that it’s ridiculous. Also, the many mini-dungeons are really BORING. I know the previous games had smaller environments because of the consoles. But it also just worked pretty well for the games. Everything felt connected. I don’t feel that with Elden Ring.

- The lock-on system is still awful and they REALLY need to update it with their next game as well.
- Controls are clunky.
- Way too many useless spirits.
- Unless you are hardcore and have A LOT of time, good luck finding and understanding most things in the game without online guides. Some of these quests are old-school Nintendo Castlevania ♥♥♥♥ and not that interesting. Of course, this is not new to the Souls series.

For me the game is a 3/5 Stars
It’s not bad and there is fun to be had. No doubt. For me it’s just a mixed bag. + not greedy tactics from the publisher is good. But for me games like Bloodborne (PS4 only sadly) and Dark Souls 3 is still their best games to date.";122.6;0.0;0.0;258.0;Posted: May 21

This is arguably the 4th best Soulsborne game. Then bosses go from laughably easy, boring and cheap. Don't make this your first Fromsoftware game. The open word is fine but nothing special.

I only had this game briefly, so keep that in mind.

Having said that, I was literally driven off by how actively hostile the controls are for PC players on mouse and keyboard. In theory, I imagine its possible to actually remap the controls to something that makes sense, but when the menu system assumes I've got a gamepad controller makes it almost impossible. C'mon, you can literally detect what devices I've got connected to my PC, and despite that, its telling me to hit a button on a gamepad that doesn't exist to confirm keybind changes.

After about fifteen minutes, and a couple Google searches on what the hell to do, I realized that I shouldn't have to be doing this to *start* a game.

So I refunded the game. Screw this, I've got other ♥♥♥♥ to do.";0.3;0.0;0.0;155.0;Posted: May 18

Do not buy this. The UX is designed for controllers, not for keyboard and mouse. You'll spend an endless amount of time battling the bad PC UX.

I was on the fence about buying Elden Ring, but I really wanted a game with action combat and interesting bosses. How bad can it be, I thought? Well, I'm sure it's great for Soulsborne fans, but if (like me) you just wanted something that was exciting without being a slog, stay away.

I'm not wholly unenthusiastic--the art direction and visual style is good, and if they fixed the numerous things I am about to list below as the problems I had, then I would genuinely enjoy the combat. I'm also told that previous games by this publisher used to be even less accessible, so progress, kind of, I guess?

But there are a lot of flaws I've already butted into with only a few hours of playtime (anyone who wants to tell me to ""git gud"" or similar should be aware there is a special circle of Hell for those who demand people treat their leisure time like a job).
--Co op with friends comes with mandatory PvP attackers you cannot opt out of. Also, no form of scaling is available to make co op with higher level friends more functional if you are starting out.
--Currency and XP are the same thing, and both are lost on death. You can theoretically reclaim them, but only within a limited window, and there is no bank. Period.
--If you die, in addition to the loss of resources already mentioned, you may not be able to get to the enemy that killed you to learn how to better deal with them for a while, because pulling too many enemies at once will just murder you so you need to approach every fight cautiously--and therefore time-consumingly. Add to this that the theoretically great build variety comes with all sorts of animation details you need to learn, and you're going to be spending a lot of time in loading screens and carefully approaching enemy camps and the like.
--There are no difficulty settings of any kind, which would be a thing that would allow the good of the game to shine through without making it disrespect the player's time availability nearly so much.

Overall, this is a game I very much want to like and simply cannot. More power to those who can, but I want to warn those who like me, were tempted by the acclaim into thinking it might be a decent casual dip of a game, rather than a lifestyle you adopt for months.

Addendum: I was able to do a ton of external research and conversations with friends and get to the point where I am enjoying the game now. I stand by my original review, however, as the game should not require that level of external resource use.";55.8;0.0;3.0;92.0;Posted: May 16

What could have been a truly amazing co-op experience is unfortunately hindered by one of the worst co-op multiplayer systems implemented in a game to date. Progress is not saved for both players, meaning you have to run all bosses and objectives twice. The player being summoned will also be de-summoned after every single boss event and/or after either of the two players die. This means that throughout even a short play session you'll have to spend tons of time just re-summoning your friend, over and over and over, ad nauseam. It doesn't add anything meaningful to the gameplay cycle, and I struggle to see why they chose this system over literally any other more viable option. Finally, you'll spend lots of time struggling against invading PvP players (that you cannot disable). Now, I don't mind PvP in games (although I would of course prefer to at least have the option to choose), but when the vast majority of encounters are with players using either cheats to win or to brick your game (yes, that's a thing, they can ruin your save file by using altered items), then the whole gameplay experience takes a hard turn for the worse.";91.2;0.0;2.0;298.0;Posted: May 22

First of I want to say that I've played tons of souls and souls-like games. With that in mind, I'm extremely divided with my experience with this game and here's why.

I'll start off with the positives; the first third or half if we're being generous are downright magical, especially the first 20-30 hours or so. For me, time flew by, I stayed up all night exploring, killing tough bosses, finding out all sorts of great secrets and just had myself a blast. Open world and Dark Souls works surprisingly well...or so I thought, but more on that later.

The overall atmosphere of the game is also great and it looks gorgeous. Visuals have always been one of the better selling points of Souls-games in my opinion and they nailed that once again. Many areas in the game are as fun to look at as they are to explore and they were for the most part fairly creative with them. Exploring them is also pretty fun, although that again diminishes over time in my opinion; last third being exceptionally boring if you ask me.

One double-edged sword for me is the variety given to player to tackle the many enemies that the Lands Between throws at you. While variety is the spice of life and I'm a big spicy food enthusiast, I think this time it might have gone a bit too far. I'm the completionist type who likes to explore everything, which I did during my playthrough of the game; I explored every area, every dungeon, beat every boss, got every possible rune to get whatever ending I desired. The issue is that many of the items you get, you will just not use, which diminishes the eagerness to explore. Spells are good example of this; there are dozens of them in the game, but if you're playing a melee build, which is the most common way to play these games, you will most likely not use them all that much, or mostly a selected handful that boost your combat effectiveness. Still, I enjoyed the exploring overall, but this aspect of it did suffer as a result.

Many weapons you get might be hard to upgrade with lacking materials, so once you find what works for you, you're not likely to change, unless to have a backup weapon or two in case you want something specific, like bleed damage for example. Never before has there been an option to get so over-powered so easily, which I feel takes much charm out of the experience.

The last third of the game for me was a slog, with any battle be it just normal foe or boss being challenging in a fun way; most of them I could beat after few tries, some of which I didn't even get to hear all of the dialogue. The element of summon spirits is also fuels this much more. Code Vein, also Souls-like game, also had co-op character as integral part of it's design and in that game the difficulty of it was still well maintained. Sadly, I can't say the same for Elden Ring. One spirit summon in particular is notorious and most people who have beaten the game know what I'm talking about. Some people would say that you don't have to use it, which is true, but summon spirits are a game mechanic the game very heavily promotes, be it through upgrades, sheer amount of them you can get and how many of the bosses are seemingly made with one (or more) additional character on your side. Them taking the attention away from you, taking away the one versus one nail biting gameplay the series is known for to me is maybe the single biggest miss with this game. This is the most accessible game From Software has ever done, but I think it has come at too big of a cost. Much like horror movies, to me difficulty of the experience is just part of it's foundation; by default, some people aren't going to like it, and that's okay. With them trying to please everyone, ultimately it feels like the opposite of desired effect was reached, unless the player handicaps themselves.

Outside of the issues with the bosses and their design, the second biggest flaw that really hindered my enjoyment of the game is oddly enough the open world nature of the game. Since the player is fairly free to explore the areas in whatever order they desire, it is fairly easy to end up being too low level for a certain area and being too high level for another. Since Souls-games don't exactly show you what level you ought to be for any area (which I think is good, mind you, we don't need these games to be Ubisoft clones), it made some areas extremely boring.

In my playthrough, I visited the Raya Lucaria Academy fairly late, after I had beaten Volcano Manor. Volcano Manor was maybe the single best experience to me in the game; the entire area oozed with atmosphere, was challenging, with memorable characters, enemies and bosses. Were everything about the game to this level, I would have given this game two thumbs up for sure. When I entered Raya Lucaria Academy afterwards, it was absolute cakewalk. During my run, I think I died maybe two or three times and that was mostly due to falling, not because of enemies. I'm also by no means the most amazing gamer out there, despite being Souls veteran, but I was simply way too high of a level to the area. I really wish there was some sort of scaling option in the game to keep the areas challenging, but without it the enjoyment for me was ruined almost completely when I never had to learn the boss moves and patterns, as simply going to their face and smacking them did the trick.

I also think that the game is too big for it's own good. To me this is maybe heightened the most by the absolutely insane amount of bosses being recycled in the game. There are total of 9 truly unique boss fights in the game, with everything else being copies of at least one another boss one way or another. Some bosses you will see so many times that they lose all of their magic, like dragons or magma wyrms for example; both fights that were initially extremely fun, challenging and memorable, but by 5th time you can't help but to your roll your eyes. I would have much preferred if they had cut out chunks of the game, like the snowy area towards the end to make the rest of the experience tighter, more narrowed, focused and unique.

I quickly also want to mention riding and crafting. I was fairly neutral on both of these personally. I didn't use crafting all that much, with exception of ailment items and pots for the most part. There were tons and tons of recipes, but more often than not there was no need for them, at least not for me personally. This is maybe because gathering resources was tedious when you're not riding past a field of them or when exploring a cave. Not a bad concept, but I still felt like it wasn't utilized properly either, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me either.

As for riding, I quite enjoyed the horse combat. I liked it when especially when fighting the dragons as you could dodge the breath attacks and quickly catch up with them. Overall though I feel like this system too was a bit underutilized. This might be a personal taste thing, but to me Souls games are still better without it. Again, a hit and miss feature in my eyes.

Overall, this is the first Souls game I struggled having to finish. The highs of the game are very much up there, the first third or half of the game is truly a magical experience, definitely worth both the time and money I put into it. As the game progresses, however, the magic fades away and you're left with big, yet empty feeling world. The numerous issues that seem to go up against the very core design the series is both know and loved for makes this a bitter soup to swallow. I can't say that I hated my time with the game, but I can't say that I wholeheartedly enjoyed it either. I hope that despite the insane success of this title that From Software takes few steps back to inspect their work before starting the next project. If their next game repeats most of the things that were in the Elden Ring, it might be my very first purposeful pass for the series. And as someone who really loves these games, I hope that won't be the case.";135.9;0.0;3.0;596.0;Posted: May 21

Not as immersive or beautiful for me, as I'd expected based on the hype and reviews.

I've just started avoiding the bosses. Wen't back to a boss in west limgrave at level 27, but I still got thrashed. I've only managed to kill one ""boss"" and that was on horseback. The controller response during fights is sluggish, but that seems by design based on what I've read. (I have a good max equipment weight to equipment weight ratio) I try blocking, parrying, and dodging, and use quick and heavy blows, but when I die I've hardly scratched the boss (and lost my runes because they drop in the instance).

It just gets so annoying repeatedly dying and having to kill the same things over and over again. Other people see this as a way of levelling, but for me it's just annoying and it breaks the immersion.

I normally play with kb and mouse, but I'm using a ps controller for Elden Ring because I read so many bad reviews for kb and mouse in ER.

Other than that, it's fun killing random mobs and exploring but if you're a old-school RPG gamer, then think twice, especially at the price.

I've carried on playing to see if it gets better and reached 20 hours, so I can't get a refund. So I'll probably continue playing and just explore and avoid the bosses, just to try and get my money's worth.

I just can't, even as an admirer of the Dark Souls games and Sekiro, give this game a good rating.
Reason number 1 by far: There are so many bosses and mini bosses that are the same or just randomly put together in different combinations over and over and over again. It is boring and I am sick and tired of it. The general vibe of wanting to beat a boss and progress is just done for me in this game.
Number 2: The world gets emptier and emptier the further you progress. It's boring.
Number 3: The clipping issues on some armor are ridiculous for a 2022 game. Bull-Goat set for example is the biggest cancer I've ever seen in any game. And why does heavy armor always need to look as stupid in any FromSoft game anyway?
Number 4: Multiplayer balancing needs serious rework done.

Imagine releasing a game in 2022 with fps locked to 60. 60fps, 60hz. No FOV slider either. On top of that it's poorly optimized too.

It's a game clearly developed for last-gen consoles, devs are too clueless to properly port it over to PC. Either clueless or lazy, trash devs.

I went from Destiny 2's (2017), smooth 240fps 240hz + fov slider gameplay to Elden Ring's (2022) stuttering 60fps 60hz fishbowl FOV gameplay. 10/10 experience.

I was not aware of these issues when buying Elden Ring because it's not something you look into. I literally can't think of any recent release suffering from issues dating back to 2009. It's a joke. There's no point in reviewing the actual gameplay when they can't even get the basics right. Don't buy this on PC until they get their **** together.";0.7;0.0;1.0;152.0;Posted: May 22

After more than 90 hours of my life spent on this game I can safely say it.
This is the worst Soulsborne game I've ever played.
Uselessy long, broken boss fights, an enormous map full of the same three or four activities repeated over and over again. A tiring, obnoxious grindy experience. I really tried to like it (and maybe I actually did for like 20 hours or so), but you can probably already tell by the 90 hours I spent playing it.";92.2;0.0;2.0;1239.0;Posted: May 22

The graphics, combat mechanics, and story in this game is far outclassed by the older witcher 3. After playing cyberpunk, far cry 6, this game just seemed outdated. The characters are poorly animated, stiff, hence I just didnt care what they said. The combat was fun, despite the inefficient mechanics, but game looked and felt so old I just could not get into the story.

this game despite coming from an amazing lineage, huge open world, beautiful art design and plenty og its own specific flavor is a true testament too how little FROM cares about the people that play their games, ive played primarily offline, but i have 90 hours in the game, loads of copy and paste everywhere, horrible input lag, pvp that is always broken and horrible because they add things like bloodhound step and rivers of blood that obviously will dominate the meta nd are very annoying too counter, this is 2022 and the water is still sheer face drops too oblivion, the most pathetic enemies attacks still go through walls, parkour is still a nightmare, im left scratching my head as too what the hell anyone was thinking, why waste so much time doimg all of this ooh big thing cool and deep lore when the very basic fundamental mechanics of the game are busted, it is not intended, it is very clearly a result of FROMS ignorance or apathy. not mentioning, the camera system, the hitboxes and the fact that numerous times i have heard tales of the treatment of their employees";22.1;0.0;3.0;70.0;Posted: May 18

This game would be great IF IT DIDN'T CRASH EVERY TIME I OPEN THE GAME. Fix this buggy crap, I've spent more time trying to make it work than actually playing it. It's like the devs didn't make any attempt to make it playable. It should never have been released on PC in this condition. I've been playing the game 30 seconds at a time. Never had to close it myself, FromSoft does that for me and then has the balls to tell me ""make sure to close it properly"". What a trash port, wasted my damn money.

Update after a bit more time trying to fix the game: ITS STILL BROKE AS ♥♥♥♥. Steam Cloud Saves keeps re-enabling itself which I think may be causing crashes (on top of also potentially deleting saves, thanks valve). No matter what I do cloud saving turns itself back on. The game still crashes upon loading into the world. The only way to play is to open it like 30 damn times and just hope it doesn't crash. I have still never had the pleasure of pressing exit game myself. I play till it crashes, then open it 30 more times. ♥♥♥♥ you FromSoft and ♥♥♥♥ you Valve.";24.3;0.0;0.0;187.0;Posted: May 20

I used to like soulsborne games, but I played the entire thing and enjoyed maybe 30 minutes of it. The remaining 93 hours were not fun. The game plays like every other soulsborne but with more obnoxious enemies. The only parts I actually enjoyed were: the first dragon fight, the fire giant and Melania. It was not worth it. It is not worth your time or your money.

There are lots of little reasons I could go into, but I doubt anyone cares. According to the internet it's the best game evvaar. Until the next big thing, then it will be forgotten, like so many others. If even 1 person listens to me and doesn't buy it or uninstalls it, I will consider that 1 life I helped make better.

Elden Ring is a poorly optimized console port that is ruined by the forced install of Easy Anti-Cheat. If you prefer not to play games that are excessively difficult and that have the Dark Souls formula of saving only at bonfires with respawning enemies and way too many difficult boss battles then this game is NOT for you. Easy Anti-Cheat causes the game not to work with ANY trainer and it can also cause the game to even stop loading. There is also no campaign or true levels. You just wonder around from boss fight to boss fight with no idea if you are making any progress or not. I also could not play this game in 4k resolution because of constant frame rate drops. 1080p looks grainy and I was still getting frame rate drops using an RTX2080 and i9 processor. There is also no resolution slider and all of the game commands and instructions are for a controller and not a keyboard. I seriously regretted this purchase and promptly refunded.";0.7;0.0;0.0;118.0;Posted: May 19

I would recommend the game to people who are masochists. There are some horrible bosses in this game. The worst being late game, in the coolest areas. Lets take the Fire Giant for example. Mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fire Giant. I love being challenged, I've beaten dark souls 1-3 and I've beaten Elden Ring. But none of the bosses in any of the DS games (Except Pontiff) have made me cry in anger. This boss kills you with total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In his second phase, most of his attacks screw you over because every attack has some sort of long-ass flame particle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that blocks your vision. Not to mention the constant belly flopping and rolling. On top of all of this, he always waves his arms around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lunatic and you can hardly hit his weak spot. He can also randomly roll up onto trees in the arena making him impossible to hit. I love Elden ring, but holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ I need to let out some anger.";166.6;0.0;2.0;50.0;Posted: May 20

I tried giving this game a good review, but it simply is not fun if you ever try to summon any friends. You get invaded every 3 minutes by people with higher levels. They are always fully equipped, they are always overlevelled, and their main move is rolling. When in doubt, roll it till you make it. It's an atrocity. I've played the original Demon's Souls on PS3 where invasions added a touch of danger to the game, but this is just stupid. The developers put no thought into this at all.

Nowadays there is too many players active, and you simply can't enjoy yourself. The invasions don't add anything to the experience if they are so methodical. It's just repetitive annoyance. The only players here having fun are the invaders, everybody else be damned.

I've been trying to play the same strip of 15 meters with my friend for weeks. It's impossible, you simply can't. You get invaded over and over and over and over. 90% of the time by the same person with no life at all, who sit there and only invade.

Repetitive nonsense.

Edit: We do manage to kill the invader sometimes, but seems like we get a 10 minute grace period after which the invasions just keep on coming again. A grace period of 35 minutes or at least banning the same person from re-invading for a while would have helped. Instead you get the same invader often 3-4 times. Even if you defeat them, they just keep coming back.";61.1;0.0;3.0;366.0;Posted: May 21

Game feels like it's overwhelmingly difficult ALWAYS - we all get these games are intended to be challenging for the best of us but all I feel I'm doing in this is grinding till I can pass areas. At a glance it's a pretty solid title, once you get invested though it's basically a regret.

It basically boils down to -
Enter area, kill enemy / on success repeat.
if killed, grind, repeat step 1.

The world is ""open"" but there's not a ♥♥♥ thing to do so who cares? after you play a few hours you've basically seen the entire game just imagine bigger enemies as you go. Yawn. I'd love my 60$ back but I already wasted to much time. I fully get 99% of folks reading this will be all ""nah, get good!"" but....this is a ♥♥♥♥ game.

Steam does not give me a choice ""May be"", selected ""No"". please have some time going through the comment before making a decision.

First time player for the Soul's series - 100% recommended game.
----------------------

Player's familiar with Soul's series - I have a mixed feeling. i would not recommend the game 100 %, at least at the current sate.
Elden ring is just dark souls 3.5 with some added mechanic's like Jump, horse, Crafting, Ashes of War, added new flask system, stealth...
Approx it would take 65 - 80 hours to complete the game for the first time. it took me around approx 122 hours for my first play through

The first 35 - 40 hours, of the game you will certainly get a feel like ""this is how a open world should be made"".
Next 10 - 20 hours, ""hey i saw this guy/place some were else... its ok after all its a huge game""
After 60 hours, Fromsoftware really .. this guy for 13th time .. Copy paste *** sh** ...

fromsoftware always encouraged exploration, but Elden ring does not seems to embrace it. i may be wrong but it feels like the game was rushed. the last 30 hours or last half of the game you would feel like you experienced everything the game has to offer.
Later part of the map seems to be like a drag , a marketing stunt to show how big Elden ring is rather than user experiance.
i am not sure may be they might be adding content.

PVP - Connection error, unable to summon, Blue Katana, Red Katana, Bleed, crouch poke, spam spells, bloodhound step, un-scaled phantom, AFK farmers, glitches, ""No skill required - press L2 to win"".
fun fact, you can buy any of the in game item via black market web site .. no skill required.

Lore - 50 shades of Maiden less guys/girl .. no may be ""Queen Marika the Eternal"" i don't know.. till now.. i had a understanding that all the core fromsoftware game will have a full story associated with the main game, DLC would mostly be stand alone but as experiencing Elden ring i feel story is half baked and relay heavy on DLC.

Bosses - Hey i am a Souls player, wait and punish... find a opening, i have to learn his pattern.i just have to role for iframes...
Boss starts a comboooooooo .. still comboo is going oooon... after 30 minutes .. souls player 'does this guy ever stop.. may be i am playing wrong .. souls player ""ha finally opening"" ... Boss ""lol, animation cancel.. one shot combooooo"". souls player - screw this rot breath, Rivers of blood'.

Elden ring iconic boss ""who never knew defeat""- Infinite regeneration, has ability to travel from Earth to Moon to finish a move, input reading, unlimited Combo, unlimited poise (cannot be interrupted during a move). fromsoftware even had to make her nude to sell the game.

--------------
i also strongly recommend, not going for a Bleed or Arcane build for the first playthrough. since its not balanced its too powerfull that i don't even know the moveset for bosess in first 3 dungeons. i had to respec to have some challenge / fun.

Overall, i am not saying the game is bad.. its a really good game when compared to other open world title but not a master piece. the game has so much potential ..
you have to look at the review by a person who was inspired by fromsoftware previous work and disappointed with Elden ring.";302.1;0.0;0.0;83.0;Posted: May 19

After 60+ hours of playtime, I can say this is my least favorite game from FROMSOFTWARE. Now this is completely personal and I expect people to disagree, that's fine, but I'll still explain why I think this is their worst game. (Note that I have not played Demon's Souls or Bloodborne because I'm not buying a Playstation just for those games. I only cleared DS1 once but cleared DS2, DS3 and Sekiro multiple times each, so I don't think this is a ""git gud"" issue.)

The two main problems I have with the game are parts of the open world and the (not always but way too often) godawful enemy design.

The open world is beautiful and offers lots of options to the player, which at first glance is very nice right ? Well, it turns out that this same open worlds comes in to butcher what other souls games have been pretty great at executing : difficulty progression. Yes, in other games you could stumble upon an area you were not supposed to clear yet and get destroyed by the enemies in there, but there was a limited set of possibilities in terms of new areas that were accessible to you at a time. In Elden Ring however, you have infinite possibilities. Therefore, the pattern that starts to occur when you enter a new area is ""Either I wreck everything in here or they wreck me"". This makes for a mediocre experience at best because if something is too hard, you just walk out and go somewhere else until you find something you can actually clear. The fact that the game is so open also doesn't really fit a souls game. Maybe that's just me ? I feel like exploring should be sort of relaxing and laid back but then you find some cool ruins and you need to activate tryhard
mode to clear it. Kinda breaks the rythm of the game in my opinion. Also it kinda kills one of my favorite aspects from the Dark Souls series : the claustrophobia inducing level design. (Obviously we can still find that in the legacy dungeons which are AMAZING in both presentation and level design. There's a reason why those are by far my favorite part of the game.)

Now on the topic of the enemy design, it's been pointed out a lot already but I've heard that the enemy design was very inspired by Bloodborne enemies. You'll remember from earlier that I did NOT play Bloodborne but I did play Sekiro and I'd say that some enemies very much do feel like they were taken straight out of Sekiro and slapped into Elden Ring with no adjustments whatsoever while WE only have a DS1 moveset at our disposal. Some of them are just way too fast, some of them keep on attacking for so long you can grow a 6ft long beard before they stop and some do both. This makes for some of the most frustrating encounters I've had in any game I've played and, mostly for that reason alone, I think this game is way, way worse than all their previous games. Also don't get me started on double boss fights. It's like they picked out the pairings at random.

As I said before, the open world is insanely gorgeous and very fun to explore, but there's still this weird feeling that the game shouldn't switch from ""pleasant exploration"" to ""absolute sweatfest"" in an instant, but then again it's not THAT big of an issue. The real problem really resides in the enemy design which is really flawed in certain areas of the game. I sometimes feel like I was given a toothpick to go fight a tank. That's unfortunately not something I can enjoy.

I'm interested to hear your opinions. Are they different ? Do you agree with some of my points ?

Personally, I didn't get much out of Elden Ring. The open world could be interesting at times, and there were some interesting bosses, but for the most part I find it rather boring and think that most of what this game has to offer was done far better in the prior Soulsbourne games. The overall gameplay / boss mechanics feel rather poorly done in some aspects (huge attack delays, AoE spam, tons of frenzied attacks, etc.) and makes some fights a slog to get through. If you find that fun, great, but I much prefer the more methodical fights in the prior FromSoftware titles where learning your enemy was a far more straightforward endeavor.";20.2;0.0;3.0;380.0;Posted: May 17

After ungodly amounts of hours in Souls games, I've come to realize I don't quite enjoy playing these sorts of games anymore, and Elden Ring only exacerbates everything that turned me away from the series in the first place. Is it the sacred cows that pervades throughout all the games? Perhaps it's the pastiche of poorly realized action and RPG mechanics that only seem to blend together because the systems lack any sort of depth in the first place. Or just maybe, it's because it revels in this sort of mean-spirited, emotionally manipulative design, tacitly inserting brain worms telling you the dopamine pay-off of playing a ""hard game"" more than makes up for the impotent rage it'll definitely put you through, no matter how terrible, or lazy, or unfair, or God forbid unfun the challenges you'll face ahead are.

Why should I even care about fighting the screetards (See: Royal Revenants), or the Runebears that are more vicious and more durable than 90% of the game's bosses, or the late game enemies which are actually mobs recycled from early game content and refurbished with just enough stat bloat to 3-4 shot (in some cases 1-2) an appropriately leveled Tarnished, all of which exist solely to make a mockery of my Demigod slayer's amazing feats that would pit him in the annals as an incredible hero of legends? My character never feels stronger, or more competent at any point, the only thing that improves is my skill as a player. Now this would normally be fine, if I wasn't granted the delusion of playing a ROLE-PLAYING GAME, and it would be fine if for all the loot and skills I acquire I was granted some kind of meaningful sense of progression so I'm better suited to deal with the stronger foes of Elden Ring, but it never comes. From level 8 to 150 or so, I'm equally equipped to deal with Revenants. If this game is a ""true RPG"", then so is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Actually I take it back, even SotN has a more satisfying progression curve than ER.

Do I even need to go into the horrendous boss design of this game either? It's garbage, not just the bosses themselves (most of them do suck however), but the combat and movement itself leaves so much to be desired, tying into the original point about underutilized RPG and action mechanics I brought up earlier. These are the devs that made Bloodborne and Sekiro and we're STILL relying on roll-based movement in this high fantasy epic? What's even the point of the backstep? The new jump mechanic isn't innovation, it's a basic feature for any game that doesn't take pride in being ""antiquated"" in its design philosophy like the Souls series does. Seriously, am I the only one who thinks it's absurd you're rolling around in heavy armor just as much as a cloth-garbed Wizard would?

You know what else? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about Elden Ring's World, I don't care about the characters, the grand choices that'll define the shape of The Lands Between itself, the DEEP LORE!!! either, it's all just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dark Souls. Same old Dark Souls and it's gloomy nihilistic themes of ""regeneration and degeneration uoOOoooH"", this time with a corprophiliac fantasy writer from New Jersey on board. It's all so banal. That's the real problem of this game, it brings nothing new to the table. It's pure kitsch, even the reviews reflect this; emphasis on ""hard satisfying gameplay that doesn't hold the player's hand"" or ""an open world without quest markers blaring in your face"", all of which says little about the quality of the game itself.

The game is a miserable skinner box, and I'll only complete it out of an obligation to a friend, but I can't be assed right now. Also PvP shouldn't exist in this game.";241.8;0.0;9.0;154.0;Posted: May 19

I'm only commenting on immediately noticeable technical issues related to the game and not the game play itself

Issues:

(1) 60 FPS lock on a 2022 PC

- If you have a display that can refresh the screen faster than 60 Hz, then 60 FPS lock is pants on PC because you get screen tearing that you won't get if the game is allowed to push more than 60 FPS

(2) This game is not optimized for PC. All of in-game button popups are for XBOX controllers. I have to sit there and figure out what the keyboard equivalent to 'Y', 'A', 'B', etc., are";0.7;0.0;0.0;41.0;Posted: May 21

Play Dark Souls instead, the world is fun and expansive but the bosses are pretty ♥♥♥♥, boring, and kinda BS, a lot use tracking attacks and double combos so you often can't avoid them (which doesn't help that they have large health pools and high damage output). If you want a fair but hard fight this isn't the game, there's just way too much BS with those attacks that really just make the fight RNG rather than a matter of skill.

No idea what happened to From but they seem to have forgot the entire design philosophy of their games";20.2;0.0;1.0;284.0;Posted: May 22

Game is a slog after the capital area. Stoped having fun fighting hard bosses and would require you to make a stupidly overpowered build (with cheese) rather than actually beating bosses with the skills you've gained. Also, despite the amount of veriety in the game, you end up getting shoehorned into a build from the begiening of the game based on the weapons you've leveled up. i decided to level up the Golden Halberd and I had to constantly respec my character because I would want to try a new weapon but couldent because you wouldent know if the weapon was good or not until youve wasted all your smithing stones on the weapon. this game requires you to do reserch online to find out what build is actually good which is fine if you like min-maxing your character but terrible if you actually want to have fun playing the game. The best parts of the game are the exploration but even then there are point in the game which actively discourage you from exploring. Theres even a section of the map near the Liurnia Erdetree that DOES NOT MATCH THE terrain. I really do wish the later portions of the game were as enjoyable as the earlier parts but with all of these problems, ON TOP OF the already shoddy performance of the game on PC (i have a 3070 the game should run fine but doesnt), i cant recomend this game to anyone at it's current state. The only reason Ive decided not to continue playing and to post this reveiw is because the game constatly crashes durring the Fire Giant cutscene making progress in the game impossible, otherwise i would just be sulking to myself about how this game could be better.";64.4;0.0;2.0;58.0;Posted: May 21

Feels a little bit wrong to give a bad review considering the amount of hours I've put in and the more hours I'm going to.
But here's my take on it.

Good:
Combat is awesome. Hack and slash and going melee will definitely test your skills. You feel like you become better the more you learn about the enemy pattern and how to fight them. Even the hardest hitting enemies will feel like ants when you've farmed them 20 times.






































I've enjoyed far more from Zelda Breath of the Wild 5 hours in, compared to my 52.6 hours in Elden Ring.
Right now, I'm just FORCING MYSELF to play it because if I don't, I will lose all the knowledge, skills, quests that I know right at this very moment and will then either need to re-play the whole 50 hours, or just continue off blind again. And restart building my skills again.
The game is good. But the developers design decisions to keep this as ""Souls series by FROM SOFTWARE"", really lets this game potential to an ultimate down. What, a, shame.

I've extensively played Sekiro and DS1-3 , with multiple play throughs.
In contrast, the few really tough bosses in Elden Ring need excess RNG to win (without investing ridiculous time mastering or using cheese), and you miss that sense of reward from predicting a bosses moveset (also in sekiro's case, new skills help tip the battle in your favour in balanced ways). Certain bosses in Elden Ring feel more like a chore than a challenge.

Three other key related issues: too many copypasta enemies/bosses, crazy input reading, and overly delayed attacks. The latter two make fights feel like you're facing a computer code more than anything. There are still some wonderful areas and bosses, just not as many with the calibre of other souls games.";92.2;0.0;0.0;14.0;Posted: May 22

Requested refund after one hour of watching reload screens after death over and over. Why do people think this is fun? Battle mechanics are weird and slow. You can't run, so getting anywhere takes forever and its almost impossible to get away when you're in trouble. Camera feels super wonky to me also. It's difficult to keep track of enemies and you're dead from one hit most of the time, so that's basically the end. I guess people are into that sort of thing, but it was unclear how to actually make progress and that's just no fun for me. I'm assuming it would get better as I leveled up, but it's not worth $60 to spend a whole day not having fun just in case I might later, lol.

When the AI abide by the same rules that the player does, with more effort being put towards quality of game play and less direct attempts by the developer to kill the player, I will reinstall. As is, any issue found with the game is met with ""git gud"" instead of the proper criticism being levied towards the developers. A borderline game breaking mechanic shouldn't be dealt with, it should be removed. It isn't difficult or challenging, it is asinine and irritating.

this game has to be one of the most unfun fromsoftware games i have ever played, and i have played them all. for the first 5 or so hours the game is fine, just your run of the mill souls game. new bosses around every corner, a since of wonder as you enter a new cave or catacomb. but after limgrave everything just gets dull, reused bosses, boring areas, and empty open world makes this game lose its luster after a while.

and not im going to talk about my biggest problems with this game, the horrendus boss design. first i will talk about the bosses, 90% of the bosses in this game are reused.. from seems to think ""putting two bosses together in a tiny room will make this boss good"" but its just not fun. walking into a room after walking through a reused dungeon just to see a reused boss, or god forbid two reused bosses in the same room get old after the second time. and they didnt even think about balancing the bosses that you run into, like the godskin duo. two bosses that are super fast, deal too much damage, and can read your imputs does not make a fun boss, it makes a boss that makes you regret buying this game.";1.0;0.0;2.0;54.0;Posted: May 16

If you like souls games, I assume you'll like this game. But if you didn't like Dark Souls and friends, don't bother with this game. I see lots of people saying, ""This time it's different! If you don't like souls games because you keep dying, just run around and become super-powerful in the new open world before you fight any bosses, then they'll all be a breeze!""

I find this notion that I will become powerful enough to breeze through every ""boss"" very hard to believe.(*)
This advice sounds like, ""grind your life away picking up power-ups for hours before you get to start to play the game in a meaningful way"", which is not a great sales pitch IMHO.

Some people love these kind of games, and I'm really happy for them, as I've heard they really like this game—the pinnacle of the genre, perhaps.

I'm just here to say: if you didn't like Dark Souls et al., you're most likely not going to like this game.

Probably a lot of fun for people who don't have to work for a living. I have always avoided Dark souls games and Dark souls like games because i knew it wasn't my thing. Unfortunately, I heard and read all of the great reviews and since I'm out of other great games to play I purchased this one. Buyers remorse.

If you don't have enough stress in your life and need something that makes you want to kick puppies, if hours worth of pissing contests is your cup of tea, if you tend to only enjoy the combat in games, this is the game for you!
If however, you are the type of person who plays games to wind down or have fun, I'd suggest you pass.

Elden ring is like going through a maze with a blind fold on while people hit you in the face with baseball bats. The little bit of story there is in the game tends to have many steps to it and very little of it has any guidance, expect extensive use of Google. If the game actually tried to have a meaningful story, other than a general idea of one, it could have been enjoyable enough to justify the purchase for me but as it stands it was a waste.

The good:
- Graphics are about average for current games (character creation is an exception).
- Combat, while most often frustrating can be fun sometimes.
- The builds and leveling seem rewarding and can be interesting.
- Finding something interesting or a secret area can often be an enjoyable experience.
- Mods made the game playable for me. I shouldn't have to mod a game to make it enjoyable, at least it's not terribly difficult to do.

The bad:
- The characters you meet in the game are mostly shallow, not well written or have any real effort put into them. After 70 hours of play, I haven't found any character I care about or care what they have to say.
- Very little direction as to where to go and what to do, some see this as a positive but I don't because the only way to find out your in the wrong place is to get your face beat in and keep getting your face beat in until you find a place where you don't get smashed(or google it). Wander aimlessly around until you find something interesting and repeat that until you can get through one of the areas where you previously got your face beat in.
- Character creation is clunky and out dated. Women don't really look like women, they look like ugly men with boobs. It feels like the designers forgot to have women in the game and added the option last minute?
- Can't figure out where to go to get that thing you need to progress to the next area? Google. Can't figure out where to find that weapon or armor you need? Google. Google. Google..... Annoying.
- Experience points and money are the same thing. Interesting idea except that you can lose it all when you die. Losing hours worth of experience when you are unable to get to the same place you died isn't fun. While it's not a big deal early game, late game when you are talking about millions of experience is a big deal and not fun.
- Online play. While Co-op could be fun the rest is really stupid and pointless. Invasions are for those who really enjoy the pissing contest aspect of the game, really not my thing, I'm not 12. The notes players can leave for other players could be interesting and worth while if the people who were leaving notes weren't 12 and obsessed with genitalia and butts. The blood stains allowing you to see how other people died is rarely ever useful either as it's mostly just people jumping off cliffs or doing something similarly stupid. The ghosts of other players and the path they take is also interesting but again poorly executed as they look a lot like the ghost mobs so they can cause frustrating deaths when you mistake a player's ghost for a mob while you are in a dark cave where you can't really tell what is going on in the first place.";69.9;0.0;4.0;65.0;Posted: May 20

The playerbase might as well have never existed on PC. Server connection and packet consistence is pathetic for a paid game.

The bosses are extremely fun and so is the theorycrafting, and you will be left to find the game has zero replayability, NG+ is also easier than the first run. Way to go FromSoft.

First of all 10/10! top 3 Games I've ever played!

This is one of the best games ever made. Titanfall 2 is flawless as it pieces one of the best most emotional and fun Stories in just 8 hours of gameplay. The content never gets dry as you are either always moving, shooting and wall running accompanied by Fantastic Music that compliments the intense nature of the battle between the IMC and Malitia. I had one of the largest smiles ever throughout this entire game with occasional sad moments sprinkled between. If you are into fast paced action packed shooters with a great soundtrack, Story and Movement I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Titanfall 2!! - 10/10

My super nice Friend Bought me this Game as he said I needed to experience it! I'll tell you one thing, that was the best decision hes ever made!

Great game.
Story is nice and flows really well, BT is the best character I've seen in a while and the protagonist has quite some personality to him, what makes everything even more fun.
Gauntlet is fun to grind and try to improve your time. I've played for a few hours (story full + multiplayer) and at least one hour was just the Gauntlet alone (the speedrun area of the tutorial).
Multiplayer feels nice and quite balanced (with few exceptions because terrain adds so much to how you should fight with your titan or which one is gonna be best) and I wish more people played it! Like, I wanna play it every once in a while now just for the fun of it.
Anyway, I'm gonna go play the story in a harder setting now and enjoy my game. I'm loving it!

Honestly one of the best games i've ever played. It has a great campaign (the best in my opinion) witch is really immersing. The multiplayer was great back in 2017 when I used to play on console, I'd never really played any shooters before and this got me addicted.

I can confirm that the singleplayer campaign is truly great. The story is bit cheesy at times, but that's what you expect from a mainstream game that could be a Hollywood action blockbuster movie. Apart from that it is truly fun and original and there is not a single bit of filler content. I would even say it's the best 1st person shooter singleplayer campaign I've played in my life. The game also runs and looks great on max settings @1080p on my RX570.

Can't say anything about the multiplayer as I'm not that interested in it, but if you like 1st person shooters it's a must play for the campaign alone.";5.4;1.0;0.0;1113.0;Posted: May 22

This is shockingly good. Not a particularly long campaign but nevertheless, one that's loaded with solid moments and enjoyable set-pieces. The guns pretty much all feel enjoyably meaty and dangerous, the mech combat is smooth and only slightly over-energetic, the wall-running and jumping works better than it has any right to and the couple of here-again, gone-again mechanics that crop up (an underwhelming cloak, an electrical gun and flat-out time travel) are implemented well (except for the cloak, which lasts about as long as it takes to push the button and that's it).

Regrettably, all the DLC looks to be multiplayer, so I won't bother with it but if there was another campaign or an expansion of one, I'd be buying it right now instead of typing this.

Hell, it was even worth installing Origin for.";9.3;1.0;1.0;436.0;Posted: May 18

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.";0.9;1.0;0.0;169.0;Posted: May 16

Finding a game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ project. If you want to play with friends, good luck. You will invite each other to the team and you have an average changes of getting an invite after 3-4 requests. Then once you go into a party, you have a chance of about 1 in 5 to actually get into a match, since most of the time you are going to get disconnected.
Worst part is you can prepare the loadout as much as you want, but if you get a disconnect, everything will be returned. My friend reached lvl 50 to increase his gen, it took us 1 HOUR to be able for him to do his gen, and get into a match. I think we had 20 tries and each damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ try he had to do it ALL OVER AGAIN. I don't know if it's DDoS attacks or what not, but at this point either stop supporting the damn game if you are that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid and can't put a DDoS protection in place (And this happens in Apex Legends as well, mostly in ranked) or hire someone with at least half a brain that can write the damn code properly.

Let me start by saying that this game is absolutely a very good game with very nice graphics and it runs smooth as silk. Its probably well worth the money if you play online. If you're not into online play, though, this game is only good when you get it at a MASSIVE discount. With only 9 hours of gameplay in 'offline' mode (and I've been slacking with progressing) its hard to get value for the money.

It feels good to play, but the game is mostly pvp, so I can see it getting boring really quick, the campaign is so short that it feels more like a tech demo, and ends with this almost condescending ending where your guy talks about what hes going to do next, like there's room for a sequel, and you're actually supposed to care about any of the characters that were on screen for like 5min max at any time. Its a 5-8 hour long game that acts like its taken 20 hours to build up lore and flesh out characters, and for that it feels extremely half baked.

I would normally just trash talk a game that has this little actual content; but I got it on sale for less than $5.00, and if you can get a discount like that again any point down the line; that's where I'd say you're getting your money's worth.

EDIT: Just went into pvp, unstable servers, the most barebones customization, and a microtransaction system that restricts access to your ability to purchase a $20 buy everything pack if you have a single thing from said pack on its own (which is standard with the only version of the game you can purchase).

TL:DR sad EA cashgrab is sad EA cashgrab, I'm glad I only spent like $5 to buy it.";14.1;0.0;0.0;207.0;Posted: May 20

WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PLAYERS:

The online servers are absolute trash, and you MUST HAVE MODS in order to get the servers to matchmake smoothly. The average wait time for matchmaking, assuming you have no mods, is twelve minutes. It is a slim chance you actually get to enter a game before the server times out for one of its many arbitrary reasons.

If all you're looking for is a single player campaign in the style of games such as Mech Warriors and the like, go ahead and get this on a heavy sale.

I, however, will be refunding this hunk o' junk and never looking back.";1.8;0.0;12.0;138.0;Posted: May 16

I'm disappointed.

So, to follow this up I want to go through why. I redownloaded Titanfall 2 Last night hoping to go have a good time with my friend: he convinced me to redownload so we can goof around in a 1 on 1 match where we'd beat the snot out of each other.

I go through 3 hours of redownloading the game when I finally get to the menu. It should be a straight shot to the Multiplayer - even straighter of a shot considering that this would be a 1v1 between with a friend.

I am unable to access Multiplayer. I don't mean that the server list is empty, I mean that I cannot press the Multiplayer button. I've spent over seven hours today just trying to find fixes to get around this issue. I've gone to a 6-Year-old forum post trying to find a fix to this issue. When that failed I decided to verify the game files, hoping that it was still something that I might be able to fix without a heavy commitment on my part: I did that for a second time with no discernable effect.

I decided to hell with it and uninstalled the game so that I could reinstall it, wasting another 3 hours hoping to try and get it running again. I finally get back in and find that nothing had changed. By this point, I download NorthStar hoping to circumvent the Respawn Servers, which did fix a few issues: Namely finally getting the game to register it was connected to servers, and allow for the information that would display on the righthand side of the menu screen to reappear.

It didn't do a thing. Multiplayer is still locked out for me, and I am stuck in an infinite search for the Respawn Servers. I hate this. I shouldn't have to be expected to run loops just to get my own game working just so I can play a match that at most would likely last 33 Minutes. What I hate most about all of this is that I LOVE this game: I've played through the campaign around six times already, and I have nearly all of the achievements for this game - and on top of that while trying to wait to see if the servers would show themselves I decided to play it again, getting halfway through it as of the time of this writing.

I'm just frustrated that this game: which I know was working prior to me uninstalling the game for space, will let me access the Multiplayer perfectly well. I also know that as of late the game servers have been under attack by petty vindictive manchildren who are incapable of having any agency or power in their own lives and have turned to DDOSing the servers to deny anyone the ability to play.

I am fairly certain that the servers I'm a part of are not undergoing a DDOS attack: I've been checking the Steam Forums and Reddit Forums for solutions all day and I haven't seen any indication of a server-wide attack denying people access to the Multiplayer.

I hate what I've done here in making this review, but I feel it's warranted for the time being: if you go ahead and decide to buy this game I really hope you don't regret it: I've gotten mostly nothing but enjoyment out of it all. However, as of right now this issue has left nothing but a foul taste in my mouth.

As of currently, I do not recommend buying Titanfall 2 if you were hoping to play the Multiplayer, in any capacity. For the current situation, I'd only buy the game for its Campaign. I genuinely hope for the future that whatever it is that's causing this issue that appears to be affecting me is resolved.";41.4;0.0;0.0;112.0;Posted: May 21

Don't get me wrong i absolutely love the game, but Respawn and EA have completely abandoned it.
Campaign is a MUST , but sadly the multiplayer is completely neglected and abandoned
multiplayer still works if you install the north star client, but im not reviewing another client, im reviewing the state of TF2

BEFORE YOU PURCHASE:
My favorite shooting game. I don't know of any that can really match the fun I have had with this game. However, the servers are all but gone. There seems to be no hope for repairing this. This means no new events, no new maps, no new guns, no new skins, no new titans, no new abilities, and when the servers still worked, a low player count. The devs don't care for this game anymore. The modding community which could be shut down at any moment is the only reason this game still is playable. I love this game so much after my origin account was stolen the first time and origin didn't let me get my account back i bought it again. If only apex legends was not the only focus of this company. This was truly my favorite shooter.";54.5;0.0;2.0;557.0;Posted: May 18

Game seems good, it's nice to have a brain-free FPS once in a while. But I don't recommend buying it because but I haven't made nearly enough progress to judge because it...
- requires the Origin launcher to run
- seems to crash randomly (no other game does this!)
- frequently just doesn't launch, or crashes before the level begins, requiring a reboot to fix it
I hadn't realised it was EA until after I'd handed over the money, but having read online that seems to explain most of the problems.";10.2;0.0;1.0;180.0;Posted: May 19

This game is actually decent. I can kind of recommend it if you KIND OF like mechs and you enjoy a typical, old school formula FPS.

If mechs give you more than a passing interest, this game really doesn't cut it. It's literally a scaled up FPS, and what's worse is the campaign barely cares about giving you proper mech battles. Outside of the mech combat, you have a very competent but incredibly straightforward shooter that's focused on cloaking, wall running, and double jumping, and there are some other gimmicks in the story like time travel that make parkour interesting for like 3 minutes before you move on to something else. I left the game each time feeling like I mildly enjoyed it. It really has no flaws to speak of. It just doesn't do anything new or interesting. The mech combat is just ok. The parkour is just ok, and the shooting is just ok. Other games of this caliber focusing on a single one of these aspects instead of all 3 at once will surely be better.

Also, I'm writing strictly about the campaign mode because PVP is essentially dead. I don't think it's off to say this was probably supposed to be a PVP game first with the campaign added to get more buyers, because the campaign is a little short and shallow all by itself.";11.1;0.0;1.0;419.0;Posted: May 21

From an objective standpoint, you cannot advertise your game as PVP or co-op if you do not maintain the official servers or at least have a browsing ability for players to readily access private servers.

It's still a good game, even though it's missing a lot of potential because EA shelved it. But this is a hazard to consumers, and I cannot fathom how you can possibly still sell/market this game legally. (I mean Northstar exists, and I don't want to prevent people from potentially buying and using the northstar client but this is more of a shot at EA than anything.)

How can EA get away with this legally? Offering an easily accessible multiplayer mode which is actively harmful to the consumer because it is unprotected. Like, on one end I don't want them to remove multiplayer because I know clients like Northstar exist, and even with Dark Souls people had been patching multiplayer with Blue Sentinel. On the other hand, how is this even legal for EA to do? I've seen companies get sued for way less than this, but EA can do this freely? They don't even have to like, notify their players that this is an issue with an in-game announcement or warning, or even anything on the community tab. They can just sit back and watch the money flow in.

I love you Titanfall 2, but publishers can suck, and I can't take your side on this review. This is actively harmful to consumers, and the only official awareness about the issues with the multiplayer is by word of mouth among the consumers.";119.4;0.0;6.0;970.0;Posted: May 19

This game was great back in the day, and if you can get it to run and find matches, you'll likely love it.

HOWEVER!

For a lot of people, myself included, getting the game to launch is nearly impossible. And when it does launch, you'll struggle to find a match, when you do find a match, don't be surprised if you get a timeout error while connecting.

Also apparently there's a ton of hackers in the game, I don't know for sure because I can't get into a match.";0.2;0.0;8.0;201.0;Posted: May 17

You need to have an EA account and Origin installed (had to recover my EA password cuz it's been 15 years since I last logged in LUL)
Played the campaign on Hard difficulty. Solid gameplay and graphics. You cannot ask for more.
Now about multiplayer.... the community doesn't have a consensus but I'm trying to be unbiased here: It's not working properly connection wise. From what I've gathered there has been a lot of DDoS attacks on the servers and EA abandoned ship, at least from trying to stabilize them.
You're stuck on a scuffed ass multiplayer connection where you can get timed out constantly while trying to find a match, wait 5 minutes after just clicking the multiplayer button, another 5-10 minutes to get into a match. So it's a suboptimal experience, WAIT FOR A SALE LIKE I DID.
(edit: If you're trying to play this without any friends, consider the server issues 5x worst)
Northstar client fixes these connection issues, although dedicated servers are on Europe and North America, so most of the 3rd world gang gets that 200+ ping treatment. And some game modes are locked in there rip.";42.3;0.0;4.0;33.0;Posted: 18 May

Initial impressions are of a clunky game, poor item management and a very bland story so far.

Lots of weird game design decisions...

Random fella' attacks you, you kill him in self-defense, bam, you're wanted for murder. Excuse me?

Poorly ported purchasing mechanics often leads to buying the wrong item, no sell-back AND game apparently auto-saves after each transaction. Perfect way of ensuring maxium annoyance.";17.3;0.0;1.0;1057.0;Posted: May 22

Imagine one of the better Telltale games. Their first Walking Dead maybe, or perhaps Wolf Among Us. Now imagine that instead of being able to control all of the interesting choices you only controlled the walking around parts in-between. Then imagine the controls for those walking around parts were god-awful.

If you want an ""on the range life"" simulator game then this is probably great for you. Otherwise the controls are sluggish, restrictive, and automated in a way that will screw you over multiple times. Regardless of your inputs the game has layers of automation that will change what you're doing: make you slower, make you jump when you don't want, change your loadout, or kill your horse. The story is fine but it's no better than any old spaghetti western that already exists, except this is extraordinarily ham-handed. Every mission, every cutscene, is extravagently and self-indulgently drawn out to absurd lengths for the content on display.

Then to top it all it's still ridiculously buggy. My personal favorite bug came when I encountered a woman being kidnapped. I shot the kidnapper off of his horse, causing the woman to fall. The process of the fall apparently caused the game to re-classify her as a witness to her kidnappers murder. This made me wanted for murder. I then went to free the woman. The act of freeing her caused the game to add me to the, now empty, role of kidnapper. This made me wanted for kidnapping. But not all of the bugs are grand and entertaining, most are just small and frustrating.

From what I can tell this game earned a good reputation as an ""on the range life"" simulator with good graphics. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy any other part of this mess.";30.2;0.0;0.0;167.0;Posted: May 23

world is vivid and feels so real. you can do plenty of things there. this is a pro.

problem is, i do not like its story. i do not agree with arthur on many things. so i can not fit in when i roleplay. i am paragon and do not wanna be a villain. but when arthur beat an innocent people when i wanted to leave by riding a horse but somehow i triggered cutscene of me beating the innocent man, this sucks.
as a player i feel i do not have freedom to decide when i can finish the quest and how i can finish it.
also you do not have manuel save/load. because you do not have that freedom neither. congrats because you just have to start a new game to redone what you have done.
can you not save mike? no. can you avoid strawberry massacre? also no. so yea you totally have no freedom.
and oh, btw, arthur you beat a dying man in front of his wife and his kids. shame on you, thug.

First of all, my bad rating is NOT about the game since it's an absolute masterpiece; my rating is to Rockstar directly.

I was playing this game and enjoying every minute of it, until I had the bright idea to get and install GTAV. Boy was that a BAAAAAAD idea! Thing was, the Rockstar launcher stopped connecting all of a sudden. Funny thing was, I closed RDR2 to play GTAV, since it didn't work, I tried to go back to RDR2 but it just wouldn't let me, even though I had just closed it 10 minutes ago. I tried EVERYTHING! Even the Social Club webpage wouldn't load. Then I noticed there are complaints about the same thing as far back as 2016 until this day.

definitely not as good as the first one. half of the map is on land, but the movement physics and creature mechanics there are lackluster and often annoying. since half of the map is on land it means theres less content in sea. they shouldve focused all of their efforts on the underwater part because the underwater biomes are not as good compared to the ones in first game and often look murky, barren and boring. despite all of this its still a subnautica game and you will get your fair share of clutch moments with local fauna. the tapeworm infested crystal caves were actually pretty amusing";22.1;1.0;0.0;254.0;Posted: May 22

Not as good as the original, but just as awesome!

Pro's:
- Very cool if short story, it's about the architects! (man, I hope this story continues!)
- Some cool new things like:
- Jukebox with some pretty cool music
- Little RC robots
- Surface exploration
- Cold tech (instead of radiation I guess)
- Snow man!

Con's:
- Very little new content. A lot of assets have been recycled from the orignal game. Which is fine but:
- Some useless new things like:
- Hoverbike (this thing is crap and useless, you are better off using the prawnsuit as the hoverbike has nothing but drawback and no benefits. Also handles worse than de damn 90m Sea truck)
- Fur suit against the cold (completely useless, in order to make it you need to traverse the cold to get some ingerdients. By the time you make it you have already figured you can use the prawn to traverse land)
- Some useless old things like:
- Containment for breeding fish (what for?? by the time you can build containment you dont need the fish. Unlike the original game where there was at least one species that was worth breeding. In sub zero there is no species that produces anything useful other than food and water. For which you have superior alternatives by the time you can build a containment unit)
- Nuclear reactor, no need. Since there is no real need or insentive to build deep bases youll end up with just your main base which is at the surface. Even if you didnt build it on top of the geothermal vents (for more power) a few extra solar panels will keep your base going without needing to make or store (depleted) fuel rods for your nuclear reactor.
- Bio reactor (see above, no real need)

In short:
Though I love subnautica I was deeply dissapointed. The map is much smaller and I expected more from the surface exploration part of the game. Base building is mostly the same as in the original game but there is now even less insentive to build multiple bases. The map is simply so small it is not worth your time. The sea truck is a beatiful edition to this game Vs. the cyclops and it was needed too. The cyclops would not work on this far too small map.

There are however beautiful new biomes to explore, some heavily repurposed and redesigned assets though, but they remains breathtaking. The story is fun to go through and explore, as the game is suppose to be an exploration game. But there is essentially 0 replayability.

I hope Subnautica 3 does the opposite of this release. And instead comes with a vast, vast, vast ocean to travel accros to give more plausible sense of actual ocean life and some more clever ways to make outpost building more appealing. If you loved Subnautica as I do, you will certainly enjoy this game too. But as for the same thrill of novelty as in Subnautica, you can forget about that alas. I guess I had too high of an expectation. The game feels rushed and though technically is perfectly sound, content wise it feels rather unpolished.

I finished the game in well under 50 hours. And though it's clear Alterra is covering sh*t up, it's still not clear what EXACTLY happened out there. For one thing, there is no reason Alterra would abandon the entire project like that! And what happened to the rest of the team?";51.6;1.0;0.0;271.0;Posted: May 20

The game is great, however,
I found the 1st game much more scary. I remember quite fondly of the time i was in the more tropical parts of 4546B, praying to god they don't catch me and in this game you just don't quite get the same feeling. Secondly I think that the first game felt a bit more...personal, like it was me that was doing things, like it was me that was me experiencing these events, while in below zero I felt like it was a character who already had a story and goals, and I wasn't finding new goals for myself and I wasn't creating my own story . Also, while I'm here I need to say that the theme of isolation was much better done in subnautica, there, my thoughts where only my own, but here, robin saying stuff just breaks the isolation to me, though I didn't mind anyone else talking. Still on the topic of a personal experience, in this game your alien friend Al-An tells you where to go, and while yes, the first game had distress signals that were also telling you where to go, you always explored a bit further because you wanted to know what lies in the unknown and that way you made your own little personal discoveries. However I must say they made the game really gorgeous and fixed a lot of annoying bugs and the quality of life is far better. I especially like the new air bladder. The prawn suit feels much more powerful and epic. I was really mad when I heard the voice actor for the PDA, but she grew on me. The jump jet isnt useless on land anymore and I can now literally fly with the grappling hook, is really fun. I love Al-An
And I was sooooo stoked when I heard margeruit's voice and damn that exosuit was so cool. All the characters feel like real people, the voice actors did an amazing job, but man was I sad when I saw the name of the last achievement. This game cannot be rated because I think it is different for everyone, but in my personal opinion you should buy it.
TL;DR: All praise Margeruit
P.S. I feel the need to say how cool everything about Margeruit is again.";30.1;1.0;0.0;37.0;Posted: May 17

I do not recommend this game. I have recommended the first one tentatively in the past because of the environment storytelling and open world exploration aspects (the soundtrack for the first game is dope AF as well), but warned against level of resource grind and god awful movement scheme for the vehicles. This game has less of that, is shorter as well, but ultimately has a number of flaws that are unacceptable for me.

Number one, the devs STILL don't know how to make a stable piece of software that doesn't crash every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10 minutes. This may be the first issue you encounter. I say may, because others have told me that they haven't experienced any problems, or very few at least. Yet others still have agreed with me that they can barely have a decent length game session. Save files can and do corrupt and back ups of your save need to be made to preserve any kind of progress.

Number two, is the utterly horrible design decision with the ice worms towards the end of the game. This part alone is what's brought me to abandon my playthrough of this game. Massive worms that can sense any and all movement on the surface of the ice fields that you must cross to advance the story. You CANNOT skip this. You are soft locked out of completing the game is you try to skip it. The mechanic of having to navigate the ice worms itself isn't the issue (think sand worms from Dune, because the devs certainly were). It's the implementation. They provide you with a thumper, a craftable device that you spike into the ground (kinda like what you see in Dune) to distract the ice worm. Only these thumpers have an 80 metre range and once you move beyond that range you are attacked by yet another ice worm. It is also possible to get stun locked. If you move, you're attacked. If you don't move you can't progress. This would be fine if the tools given to you to tackle this problem actually worked. But they don't. It is clearly possible to complete the game because others have, however it seems more a test of patience rather than ingenuity on the part of the player. Hard pass for me.

Number three, movement speed underwater has been lowered. What in the name of every deity ever conceived by humanity were the devs thinking? Smooth movement and a decent level of speed is ESSENTIAL for first person games. In the first game you would glide around effortlessly which made the underwater world exploration a joy to experience (when using the seaglide or the seamoth). Now you're slower and possibly there's more inertia. You get used to it, but it's still terrible.

Number four, the vehicles suck dog nads. The first game had the seamoth (a tiny submarine that was like a space ship which you can zip around in fluidly - 10/10); the prawn (a cumbersome mech that walked on the ocean floor and relied on jump jets and a grappling hook for scaling high areas - 7/10); and finally the cyclops (an impressive looking submarine that many people turned into a mobile base, but had god awful controls - 5/10) They all make sense within the context of the game despite my distaste for the last two. However, in this game you get the seatruck (a replacement for the seamoth AND cyclops that is a modular 'train') and the prawn. You know how I feel about the prawn (oh, and I barely got to use the damn thing). The seatruck... sigh... The cabin part is, well, it's fine. Just fine. It does what it says on the box, except you can't fit it in places that it looks like it should fit. The collision box is wonky at best and you'll find yourself clipping things ALL THE TIME. As you add more modules onto the cabin section you'll slow the vehicle down. Understandable, but SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW! Meaning, unless you can tolerate moving at a glacial pace, you'll be fine modding out your seatruck to your heart's content. But if you actually want to get ♥♥♥♥ done because, you know, you have a life to live, then good luck.

I've ordered my gripes in order of most unacceptable to least unacceptable. Honestly, it's not a bad game, but the constant crashing and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid design decisions surrounding the ice worms broke the game for me. I got it on sale for a little more than $20AUD and I got 20 hours of gameplay out of it, so there is that. But I was unable to complete the game. Make up your own minds about this one. I don't recommend it, but if you have the patience to get through it then perhaps it's for you.";20.7;0.0;0.0;287.0;Posted: May 21

Its not terrible, it's more Subnautica just a little different.
The problem with the game is everything above water. I tried not to use any maps on the internet. But jesus christ after getting lost for 2 hours and looping around the same place I realized I didn't want to waste a single second up there anymore. Opened up a map and beelined for the plot places and never returned.

I have played the first Subnautica multiple times with 73 hours and feel like I could still play more.

I do not love this one. Nothing that was good about the original shows its face in this game. I don't even know how to criticize it, it's all just a huge blur of mediocrity. No isolation, no tantalizing mystery to uncover, a map that feels cramped and bizarre, mechanics that are redundant and unsatisfying.

Original Subnatica is one of my most favorite games of all times. It was appearent that the follow up game would have it difficult as succeding the original was a tough task.

I didnt manage to finish this game. At one point I just gave up and rather restarted original Subnatica. I will still buy Subnautica 3 when it comes out. But Subnautica: Bellow Zero is simply a downgrade story wise and gameplay wise over the original game.

Yes, there are some nice things. Graphic is bit better, the new vehicle that replaced Cyclops was kind of fun, although I miss my Cyclops. Some quality of life improvements were done. Not sure if all are for the better but generally yes.

The negative side is certainly the world or map whatever you call it. Its way more streamlined and limited exploration wise. I didnt enjoy the ground part much either.

The story and overall feeling of the game cannot be even compared with the original. Original game story was so simple (you crash, try to survive and escape) and yet so much better. The atmosphere of the first game is in different league. In my first gameplay of Subnautica I felt totally absorbed, I was stressed about unknown and dangers that might be there somewhere (Subnatica did excellent job creating a sense of danger where in reality was very little of it if you were focused).

Original Subnatica scores 10/10.

I would give this game a neutral review, its ok and i like survival base building a lot especially when it comes with a mystery. But it fails to bring back any of the charm of the first game. In Subnautica you were stranded and the goeal was to get off the planet, the alien subplot was just part of your journey.

Now you come to the planet to find out what heppend to your sister and get an alien stuck in your head wich becomes the main plot. You dont have to find out any of the sister stuff to finish the game its maybe just for NPC feelings.

And what i really dislike about the game, its to bright. In subnautica you had to use sonar to navigat the dark caverns and it was moody and scary. Now there is glowing everywhere no matter how deep you go. In completely ruins the scary vibe. The monsters in the caverns are scary the first time you meet them but they almost do no damage to your vehicle wich doesnt even need to be fully upgraded to get to the lowest point.

Basically 10 hours in the game became an annoyence and i probaly wont replay it

Also the land movement is flawed AF an i got stuck multiple times";29.4;0.0;0.0;287.0;Posted: May 19

This game relies on fear to create the idea of vastness. If you are not scared of the concepts in this game, it becomes small quickly. The storyline for AL-AN is concise, and the average player could complete the game in its entirety in less than 5 hours. Another gripe is that this is the SECOND time they have teased us with enormous leviathans. I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone when I say that people don't want to see out of commission leviathans and think, ""What could have been.""

I would honestly go as far as to say this feels like a DLC for the original game.";36.5;0.0;0.0;58.0;Posted: May 19

I have 4.6 hours (by the time of writing this) on this game, compared to Subnautica where I have 106.

This game fails to keep me interested due to a considerable lack of innovations to the core systems of the first installment. Sure, there's a brand new story, new biomes, new creatures, plants, etc., everything is new... but the scale is still somehow smaller than how the original Subnautica felt.

Submarines are, personally, quite lacking. The Sea Truck is, in my opinion, a disappointment on several levels. The lack of the original game's Seamoth and Cyclops makes exploring the game for new technologies feel less rewarding and it feels like you have less of a personal goal in this outside of the story, which seems to rush you toward a certain goal more than the last one did, which was extremely focused on freedom of pacing whereas this one just hammers the point over your head several times over and always forces you to remember ""Oh yeah, I need to do this"".
This isn't necessarily a wrong thing to do, it just feels like this game is a downgrade compared to the original Subnautica, and seeing how the developers, for some reason, seem to not only refuse but actively work against the community's wishes for bigger, more customizable submarines makes this an incredibly disappointing addition to the series. Some people might disagree, but that's just how I feel about it.

TL;DR, I enjoy what they did with the game on a visual standpoint, hands down it's much prettier than the original, but I can't help but feel like the actual game is more lacking in content than the original had and the focus on the story does more harm than good in my opinion.

Subnautica has always felt to me like an exploration game, first and foremost, with hidden lore that isn't blared out into your face unless you go looking/reading for it. The original game gave you multiple options for adventuring, what with the 3 different submarines that accomplished very different objectives, but the fact that, in this game, you only get a clunky hybrid of the seamoth and cyclops that is the Sea Truck and the Prawn Suit, which also feels a bit clunky in its own right when it comes to exploring, makes this game feel much more tedious not only when it comes to exploring, but the goal of exploring as a whole.

I'll probably finish this game for real one day, but in its present state it feels unenjoyable and like a downgrade from the original Subnautica. Go play that one instead.";4.6;0.0;1.0;229.0;Posted: May 20

Watching other reviews I was expending this to be a worse game than the original but I underestimated how bad it compares to the original.
It is not a terrible game by any means but it somehow managed to improve on things that either unimportant or that make the experience worse while keeping the core experience literally the same. It's like an expansion that makes the game worse.
So what stays the same:
- the game loop
- the story. some broad strokes change but in essence it stays the same.
- most of the resources.
- navigation
- survival elements (now you have to manage low temperatures as well. woweee)

what changes:
- Voice acting with varying quality. Did it need it? Not really
- The dialogues. The less said about these the better because they ruin the experience almost single-handedly.
- New recipes, pictures and useless items to craft. There is only one useful addition the Quantum container and that is pretty much taken from mods.
- New biomes and a couple of different creatures that fulfill pretty much the same roles as the originals.
- The ice worm which looks menacing but it's actually more dangerous to your vehicle than you.
- 2 new vehicles and one removed. The snow fox sounds cool but controls awful.

Aaaaand that is pretty much it. The ending is so bad it hurts while mechanically being the same slog as the original.

This game isn't even close to as good as the first one. The biodiversity is practically non existent. I would say there are less then 10 unique species. The leviathans are boring. They are literally everywhere, and they are never an actually threat. The only thing you lose when they attack you is a minute of your time. This will happen constantly.

The maps are ugly and hard to explore. I had to use a YouTube video every step of the campaign, because everything is purposely hidden away. Remember, when the first game encouraged you to go forward? This game will only let you move forward if you find specific resources in remote hard to reach corners of the map, with no indication that they are their. Again, I had to use online guides for everything. If you want to progress the story you have to navigate the repetitive hallways filled with leviathans that hide were you are supposed to go or even any indication that you are going in the right direction.

The story is bland and progression is so hard to progress that I didn't really care by the end of it. Ex: One of the characters asks you to find them on an iceberg in a field of icebergs. The only hint is that they are around 1 km west of you. That doesn't limit you search at all, so you can spend an hour or two looking or just consult an online video.

Everything is worse than the original. I bought on sale and it was arguably worth it, but I found myself wanting to play the first one again about halfway through.

The story is cool enough but the writing is terrible. Dialogue feels canned and corny. There are characters who receive varying levels of development and I found myself most interested with the ones who had the least. I realized this was because I wanted want the original game offered - a sense of mystery.

And believe me, there is NO sense of mystery in this game. Each ""discovery"" is bookended with dialogue from two characters who, should by all accounts, be interesting... but they're not.

Vehicles are worse, environments are worse, map layout is WAY worse. in the original game I found myself quickly memorizing landmarks and shortcuts between biomes. In this game they simply don't exist. Virtually every sea cave is a walled garden. This makes navigating to specific resources overly tedious and betrays any feeling the environment you're exploring is organic.

Overall, if you loved the first game, and this is on sale, then buy. If you're torn between this and the original, go for Subnautica Classic.";33.3;0.0;2.0;181.0;Posted: 17 May

I had heard that SN Below Zero made some things better than the first part, that it avoided some of its annoyances.
So I hoped for some more hints where to find things and thus less annoying HOURS of dumb search for rare resources, blueprints and special locations.
But only the special locations are a bit easier to find than in the first part.
The search and grind for resources and blueprints is still extremely annoying.
So annoying that the game is (like already the first SN) IMO only playable when using guides, maps and debug console cheats.
Which is of course dumb: I don't want to have to use cheats or read WIKIs to be able to play this game in a way that you actually make some progress in lets say a 2 hour session and not only have searched for gold and silver in that whole time...";24.2;0.0;0.0;77.0;Posted: May 17

I would not recommend this because having completed five artefact locations and several building locations, nothing else is appearing. The story just seems to have stopped. Yet I have not finished by any means. Nothing is telling me what I need to do, nor where I need to go, no new location markers are appearing.

I have just spent five hours driving, walking and swimming around effectively not doing anything, not finding anything and am bored stupid. There is an alien presence in my head, that seems to tell you when you are near something of note, but has not spoken for those five hours.

There's so many things that below zero improved on compared to subnautica ex: how the world works, you'll see animals hunt each other with different methods and blablabla and I was amazed by the level of detail on some aspects which proved to me that the team did put a lot of work into this but not enough. All the menacing monsters look the same with the same design, they even added the boxing crab that was removed from the first game. Subnautica is a game that's supposed to be scary af, the first one had terrible graphics but it can be explained with the budget, time of release and many other things but the feeling of being in an emptiness of water with a monster that can be heard a cross the map, the story. Yeah no game's perfect but subnautica was a masterpiece it deserved more hype then it did get but that's okay. Below zero focused on things that weren't necessary to add to the dept of the game but more to the level of detail and that's cool and all but what about the actual game? I played the beta 2 years ago and I was playing the game today, after 4.6 hours of playtime I realized they added ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing in 2 years. NOTHING?!!?!??! That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, all I see is extra details but that's about it also I loved that the view was beautiful looking outside the water but 90% of the time there's a store or some ♥♥♥♥ and the effects are so poorly made that you just can't see and you go back to the water. As everyone said, every biom feels the same. There's no plot or something cool that you'll discover its just boring. BIG CONCERN: WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SO DAMN HARD TO START BUILDING?????? I hated this ♥♥♥♥, forced to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ water chests that hold nothing in them and ended up living in my water bus, why would you be restrained from building anything for 4+ hours? You're forced to go explore literally 75% of the game just to start building. No multiplayer? Seriously? in 2021, now 2022 y'all made a game that would be perfect in coop ♥♥♥ solo? It was bad enough with the first one being solo but 2014 yk yk. ITS 2021 FAMMM if your not making an open world that even has the mechanic to build underwater bases not coop is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. Y'all literally missed out on an extra 35% profit just because coop wasn't your vibe ig.


TLDR: Good attention to detail, bad story, bad enemies, no sense of fear, no coop after 7 years, big enemies are ctrl c ctrl v and all worst than the ones that were made 7 years ago. They also made a very cool monster and decided to freeze him in some ice and call it a da.";4.9;0.0;2.0;49.0;Posted: May 16

One of my absolute favourite game series, awesome puzzles, inspiring visuals and great finale to an epic co-op puzzler. This game did not disappoint. I only wish I could play more, my friend and I stopped playing for a few days just so it wouldn't finish as fast.

If you're looking into this series, the first game is free and they only get better.
Can't wait for what Total Mayhem Games bring to the table next.

P.S.
Current version of the game (v1.0.22) is buggy in places and if you want a better experience would advise waiting for a patch or more before playing but, even playing with bugs, I'm still very happy with the game.";10.3;1.0;1.0;128.0;Posted: May 17

For the fourth time I got to leave my friend behind to die, thank you Total Mayhem Games (She is salty but it was worth it!)

""We were here forever"" - yeah we sure were, as me and my partner's one collective braincell tried its best to get us through the puzzles. They were hard but satisfying those times we did manage to figure out both what to do and succeeding with it. A few times not even the hints were able to save us though and we had to look up the solution online, but other than that the puzzles were a fun step up from the previous games. Some felt familiar but were not repetitive, and the same can be said for the game overall. The co-op experience is more balanced than it's ever been and as fun as we'd hope it'd be.

At last, we did conquer even this game, despite it being played on an actual potato from my side (rest in peace dear computer, you did your best). Me and my friend were very excited for this title and ultimately, it was worth the wait.";16.5;1.0;0.0;27.0;Posted: May 22

An amazing game and upgrade from the previous games in the series. Graphics and puzzles wise. There is a lot less confusion due to missing hints and it is much clearer what went wrong. That isn't to say there weren't moments when me and my friend got stuck, but the instances were far less frustrating than in the last games in the series.

As of our playthrough (finished 6 days after release), there are still a fair few moments with framerate lag. They aren't super frequent, or at least we didn't pay it much mind. For a person whose first game might be We Were Here Forever or isn't a huge fan of the series, they might be more annoying or frustrating.

I look forward to whatever Total Mayhem Games decides to make in the future.";9.0;1.0;0.0;120.0;Posted: May 19

EDIT: After the most recent update my partner and I were able to finally finish the game. Was a great game, probably the best in the series so far. There were still bugs but nothing game breaking that had us not able to complete it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This sucks to write due to the fact that when the game works, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing.

BUT, it is basically unplayable in its current state. Spoiler warning ahead:

My partner and I have to play this in multiple sessions due to time constraints. This was working perfectly fine until we progressed to the graveyard level. Every time she tried to load into that level she would be met with a black screen. We tried all the fixes in the book and they did not work. This meant that we had to progress without saves. Seemed to be working fine, we finished the Graveyard section and placed the part in the.. gun? We then progressed to the Kraken puzzle. We ended the session there and then started again the next day. Once completing the Kraken puzzle I was locked in the room and we were unable to progress as the doors to the control room shut too fast. We restarted and then the levers to finish the Kraken level did not work. We restarted again. They worked that time and we progressed to the potion making. We finished the potion making and got the next part. Upon reaching the gun where the part goes in, we noticed that that part we previously had gotten from the graveyard level no longer existed. We then went back to the Graveyard level to try and complete it again and apon falling into the well, I was unable to pick up the pickaxe. Meaning we can not progress again. Not only that but the host is the only one who can hear sound effects on the graveyard level?

The puzzles are AMAZING and this is by far the best We Were Here game so far (I have played them all).. BUT.. it's basically unplayable in it's current state. We were fine with quickly re-playing the level but we are blocked again and again by bugs in the game hardlocking us into a restart.";16.3;1.0;0.0;608.0;Posted: May 16

One of the most fun and creative co-op games I've played. It's also a huge improvement on the previous games in the ""We Were Here""-series. The presentation really took a step up, with the soundtrack genuinely being so good I'll add it to my playlist. Story is also interesting and just kinda neat overall. Also some surprisingly hard puzzles, which again serve as really cool setpieces in the game visually.

Not all the puzzles are balanced. Spent half the game describing symbols while the other person does almost everything/the majority of the puzzling. By this I mean that one person has all the info and the other person just follows orders blindly. There are super long walks and travelling cut-scenes for no reason. Definitely the longest but not the best game in the series (unsure why people are saying it is). There are also game breaking bugs that make you restart the entire section. You're able to fall off the game map into endless oblivion by jumping off one of the ski lifts.

💙💙💙🖤🖤 Average, but not great.

The mechanics of the game are often clunky and hinder playing, many puzzles are entirely one-sided or just break for no visible reason, and most are so incredibly simple that I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this.

Not recommended. Very buggy, got soft locked multiple times. Most of the playtime was spent either running between 'puzzles' in long unneeded areas or redoing puzzles because they bugged out and soft-locked the game.

Managed to soldier through it just because at that point it was kind of funny how many bugs we could encounter and something else always managed to go wrong when trying to redo a stage. Honestly, contemplated a refund multiple times, but got the end, which was kind of abrupt itself.

The puzzles themselves are incredibly easy, most of them are not even puzzles, but just following instructions or mind-numbingly flipping lever.

I'd wait a year or so until bugs are ironed out and then I guess it would be worth it just for a casual co-op experience, but for a puzzle game, I'd look elsewhere.";12.8;0.0;2.0;715.0;Posted: May 19

Overall, just disappointing. I won't call it bad - you've got your two player puzzling and it works - but for the final(?) game in the series, the one with the longest development time and the one with the highest price tag, it feels a big step backwards from its predecessors.

It's hard to nail down exactly why, but I think it feels too tame, as if they approached this one with the mindset of really making a commercial game (the original was a student project IIRC), and were worried of scaring away players. There's no tension of having to solve a puzzle before you die to some encroaching hazard (increasingly-panicked chatter on the walkie talkies that can't both receive and transmit at the same time was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the previous games), and the puzzles are so self-contained - no more running around trying to figure out what you should be doing, instead you're typically sealed in a small area with only the puzzle elements, leaving the experience feeling overly-curated. ""Here's the next puzzle, solve it using these parts,"" goes the game, ""I'll be waiting to escort you to the next puzzle.""

On top of that, the puzzles themselves feel worse than in the previous games. Too many of the puzzles have both players simultaneously interacting with the same elements, leading to most of them ending with one person figuring it out and dictating everything to the other player. They feel more like single-player puzzles where the second player only exists to physically enter their half of the solution and maybe answer specific questions about details you know are there but can't see the exact details of.
The few asymmetrical puzzles beyond that seem to blitz through the interesting asymmetrical puzzle solving and go straight to the execution. Rather than collaboratively working out a solution you tend to see what you're supposed to do straight away followed by however much time of just repeating information back and forth, or worse one player is left really bored as their half just has so much less to do.
Really, the asymmetrical part of the co-op puzzle solving was what made the series unique, and to see it stray away from that feels like they've squandered what made the games what they are.

The game's longer than the older ones. There's more story as well, which may be hit-or-miss. I couldn't care less for it as it was the series's mechanics that held my interest, but the friend I played through them with was interested in the story. Either way, the individual puzzle quality has suffered for both. There were a couple I came out of thinking 'that one was pretty decent', but there's nothing memorable in there.

As I said at the start, I can't outright call it bad, but the development time and the price point both set expectations that the game consistently failed to meet. For half the price I likely would have been satisfied with the experience, but at full price it's just too bland.";11.5;0.0;17.0;276.0;Posted: 18 May

O pior da franquia. Mesmo gostando dos puzzles, o jogo em si é todo bugado, parece que o jogo foi rushado de um jeito ridículo. O menu do jogo já é um lobby, dar load em um save é bugado, você consegue cair para fora do mapa e não tem nenhum tipo de respawn a não ser dar load. O que mostra que o jogo foi rushado é o personagem fazer animações em algumas interações enquanto em outras o personagem fica completamente parado (animações que acontecem o tempo todo no jogo, tipo girar uma manivela). O pior é o quanto DEMORA para você se locomover nesse jogo, invés do jogo mostrar você entrando em algum lugar, andar um pouquinho e dar um load pro final ele faz você andar lentamente o caminho quase TODO sendo que não faz diferença nenhuma.

TL;DR: I wouldn't recommend buying the game currently because there are (at least in our case maybe we just unlucky idk) gamebreaking bugs related to losing saves and progress which is very frustrating.....

It would actually be a good game, if not the best of the We Were Here series, if it didn't have game-breaking bugs. At some point in the game you have to repair a machine where you need three parts that you get in three different levels. But every time we finished a level and got a machine part, the previous machine parts were reset. After we had the second machine part, the first machine part was reset, so we did both levl again. Then we got the third machine part and the other machine parts were gone again now we have to do all lvl all over again and they are not short.We tried reloadig our savegames etc. but nothing worked
Conclusion: It would be a very, very good game with very good and fun puzzles, we really had a great time...so far...I would not recommend to buy the game until the bugs are fixed, otherwise ur enjoyment on the game quickly turns into frustration.But who knows maybe we only unlucky.";12.1;0.0;0.0;170.0;Posted: May 17

My friend and I love we were here and we were here together, but this game falls short for us. We experienced almost no bugs (besides the ski-lift) and still didn't enjoy our time. The puzzles feel like they're either 1 guy with all the info, or both players with all the info, instead of an even split that would support communication like with other games in the series.

I consider the gameplay to be good, some puzzles could use a little more info but overall good puzzle design. The reason for my negative review is how piss poor the optimization for such a simple game is.... no matter what graphical settings I chose I consistently had extreme frame drops/stutters. The game was nearly unplayable due to the issues and I wouldn't recommend playing the game unless you just really want to finish the series.

Edit: After completing the game I now recommend the game even less than before, the performance was even worse in some areas and a handful of puzzles had good ideas but overall had poor execution making them very difficult to solve without extra insight... Overall still don't recommend the game unless you just need to finish the series

I am VERY conflicted on what to give this.

I'm not sure if we needed to redo puzzles to gather these pieces for some canon looking thing. There was chapter hopping (went from 2 to 4 to 5 then 3 where we might have been glitched, not to mention when we select the chapter to get back, we probably have to redo the others since each chapter had other percentages done.

At this point, Songs of Conquest is a gorgeous, stable and a mechanically bit lacking, but modern reiteration of the HoMM formula.
I believe it has a long journey ahead of it, and I'm happy to be there for it all the way till the end. The potential is crazy, and the devs convinced me, that they care about the game, and willing to take feedback to their heart. For the first time ever I'm actually willing to report bugs (the game has a pleasant in-game bug reporter), and provide suggestions to support the team. That's how special the game is for me.

I highly recommend this game especially for those that like fantasy and strategy. The pixel art style is quite nice and I enjoy the death scenes for when the last enemy dies. Also, the battle music is pretty decent. My favorite battle music in the game sounds somewhat similar to the Witcher. The campaign is engaging but I think the strong point of this game is the Skirmish for which I have spent many hours playing.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Nostalgia for HoMM 3 led me to this tile, and while I was following the game with much interest, I did not know what to expect from its early access stage. Now I do, and I felt the urge to write down my thoughts to process the substantial impact this experience left on me. It is a personal piece, and a praise, but a candid and reflected one, from which I hope that you, dear reader, can take away some conclusions, if you are in the mood for a lengthy critique. Feel free to skip to the last paragraph to find my summary.

The certainty of experiencing something special trickled in immediately upon launching the game. It required a bit of time to set up a quick skirmish game, to choose a small map, and to decide on the faction I would take, as well as that of my opponent. While my brain went to operate in strategy game learning mode, focusing on concepts and preferences and numbers, a feeling emerged, faintly at first, but soon overwhelming. At a certain threshold, I realized it was caused by the mesmerizing music, whose melancholy, pathos, subtlety, and sincerity deeply sucked me into the world of Songs of Conquest. What a fitting title for a game carried by its strong music, and with a musician in each faction! Before even starting my first play session, my analytical stance was gone, and replaced with intense immersion, joy, and anticipation. After transitioning to the actual game, my initial feelings were substantiated and further intensified by the gorgeous pixel art, the vivid animations, the rich and busy world, the vibrant and spot-on sound design, and the lore. So, if my comments appear overly enthusiastic from time to time, please bear in mind that I fell in love quickly and heavily with this one.

After being blown away and naively wandering through the exciting world for a while, my strategic thinking, while still taking a back seat, slowly returned - after all, losing is not fun, even if it is presented gorgeously. At this time, it became clear that the game did not rely on smoke and mirrors to fascinate for a brief while, but that underneath all the splendor, there exists a rock-solid foundation built from tight design, a clear vision, and great overall balance, allowing the streamlined interlocking systems to become larger than the sum of their parts. Let me explain. Many reviews complain about altered or missing features from the HoMM series, like the unit cap on stacks, the seemingly weak magic, or the difficulty to achieve lossless fights. While these design decisions certainly shift the game feel away from HoMM 3, which surely can curtail your enjoyment with the title, I see the in them thoughtful modernizations countering (in a certain way extremely satisfying) tactics such as concentrating units to render single heroes close to invincible, or winning not by units, but with vastly overpowered spells.

Songs of Conquest embraces the tension of close decisions, bloody battles and risk-reward thinking that is core to the early game feeling of the HoMM franchise, and strives to maintain it longer through the game session than its predecessors, which more often than not spiral out of control, abruptly ending runaway winning and expansion streaks through singular (albeit epic) fights between superheroes, won by the bigger doomstack (adjusted for overpowered relics, skills, and spells). Songs' experience is different, but I appreciate it highly: Lossless fights are still a thing, but they do not come granted with a large army or spellbook. The limited unit and army size encourages experimentation with different compositions, and the novel magic system further augments the relevance of unit choice, as spells are fueled by acting units, not by mana reserves. There also is a common complaint that the units do not possess enough special abilities. While the game could benefit from increased asymmetry (there is room for more abilities, faction-specific spells or building effects), the units are far from being interchangeable. Even just with basic stats, they adopt distinct combat roles. Clearly the game benefited from extensive balancing before being released into early access. Not the cookie-cutter balance evening everything interesting out of your game, but the feeling that each designed item, spell, unit and system has a purpose, even if it might be only niche. Some areas still need polish (I always wanted research in my HoMM, but the present implementation is rather formulaic), but I am impressed by what already is here.

Clarity is a big strength of Songs, and I am quite certain that the developers were extremely conscious in their decisions and executed their vision stringently. The result is a great game flow which does not overwhelm you with intricate decisions, does not waste your time with busy work (we could talk about picking up all the glitter here, though), and from time to time poses a good challenge to mix things up (enemy hero approaching capital, main hero bound with converting an enemy city, secondary and tertiary heroes exploring). Like in many good board games, simple subsystems interact to regularly create challenging decisions while keeping the outcomes and reasons for failure and success clear. This is a foundational but especially hard aspect of design: Cut what is distracting, cut what is not working properly, cut what is undermining other systems, avoid feature and scope creep, to arrive at a faceted jewel.

In the same accord, the UI is slick and presents all relevant information in a well-arranged fashion (OK, let us not talk about the town defence organization screens, these really feel clunky, but particularly so because of the ease you navigate through the rest of the game). The factions feel familiar and far from standard fantasy tropes at the same time, making them both immediately relatable and unique. While I very much appreciated HoMM's high fantasy setting (which wonderfully supports the powerful magic and the colorful and expressive range of characters), the great heaviness and sincerity of Songs' lore serves its own atmosphere excellently, which is further supported by clever presentation (I love the level up zoom and bang, the visual and sound effects when the souls of a defeated army are released (which can be heard globally, even in absence of vision, during turn calculation), and the battle victory screen highlighting the final action). These loads of immersion really got me into roleplaying feels, fighting epic battles for the good of my faction.

Nostalgia that can never be truly relived, and will always be remembered through bittersweet, rose-tinted glass. Nothing is ever perfect, and it is impossible to fulfill all expectations when trying the daring task to live up to a decade old legend. Songs of Conquest has the courage to recreate the strengths of such a legend. For this courage, it is rewarded, ending up both as a beautiful piece of art and an emerging masterpiece in its own right. It proves again that a small but capable, passionate and considerate team is able to achieve what all the disconnected executives and Ubisofts in their industrialized, greed-driven corporate mindset failed to accomplish with far more material resources and numbing crunch. But without fostering inspiration, the genuine joy of creation, and the human desire for expression, such an endeavor can never reach its true potential.

In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend Songs of Conquest to anyone looking for a crisp, holistic, nuanced, and well-flowing turn-based strategy experience, for people wanting to scratch their HoMM 3 itch in a carefully yet distinctly modernized way, and for fans of deeply atmospheric, artistic games, especially in the dark fantasy and retro settings. It is a rare example of a love letter which manages to avoid old pitfalls, knows well what to preserve, what to overhaul, what to remove and what to add, and executes on these difficult decisions with great confidence in its own qualities.";16.4;1.0;2.0;296.0;Posted: May 21

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have been having the honor to stream through the first main campaign with my community and have lots of thoughts! There won't be any spoilers since I really want people to try it themselves. As an older kid who enjoyed watching my parents play HOMM from their deskside, Songs of Conquest feels like an amazing foray into the genre and an absolutely wonderful spiritual successor. The units are all beautifully designed and animated, the campaign itself that I've been through so far has been very fun and full of interesting lore, and I've really enjoyed all the characters and scenery the game presents.
There are, in the later levels, a large difficulty spike that forces you to really be as efficient as possible; mission 3 our of 4 made me restart it entirely due to not really knowing where my town goals were, and while it was a little frustrating, I really enjoyed it actually. Going through the mission entirely blind and then using what I've learned to be more efficient and go through the level more effectively adds a lot of repeatability and really helped me appreciate my own ability to adapt and overcome challenges that I felt were previously insurmountable.

As for skirmishes, I don't have anyone in particular to play multiplayer with currently, haha, so I suppose I won't focus on that as much as I haven't gotten to play it. Game mechanics wise everything feels very sound, although I do find that some of the units being incomplete for some factions and other factions being able to have a stack of 100 vs a max stack of 50 for a base unit is a little... not great? I believe some balancing could be put into place, but it's generally pretty fair. Along with that, this IS a week one review, and I'm sure we'll get additions and stuff later on!

Lastly, while it does not effect my opinions on the gameplay itself, the dev team have been extremely kind and friendly with not only me, an extremely small content creator, but with their entire community and love to get feedback. I just wanted to note that Lavapotion have been absolutely stellar and I'm excited to see the support they give to the game in the future; we just don't have enough developers that are this devoted and lovely nowadays and wanted to give them a shoutout.

Ahh, also, the music in this game? Absolutely stellar. The sound effects all help to feel like you're playing in a fantastic ballad of an epic tale. Along with that, you get little songs for every chapter you complete in the main story, and they are all fantastic!!

TLDR: If you enjoyed HOMM or just like turn-based strategy, I think SoC could be a really fun game for you and highly recommend it!!";17.8;1.0;1.0;111.0;Posted: May 18

Reading the reviews, it sucks hearing that people think this is a cash grab. The initial campaign shows that they've dedicated a good handful of time towards creating a strong, respectful future for the HoMM genre. The game has small quirks that need to be worked out but, overall, the game is fantastic.

Combat has an interesting flair with the starting locations. I wish I could place units where I wanted to or in more varied spaces. The enemy started at an advantage but I'm also APPROACHING the enemy so I should expect that. Overall I didn't lose too much during combat and it forced me to go against my ""CHARGE WITH MY FACE"" mentality.

If you're a fan of this genre, the tactical genre, or anything strategic, you'll find love in Songs Of Conquest.

I have only played 3.5 hours up to now but I have loved every minute. I have played homam 2 and 3 throughout my childhood and I go back to the 3 once a year, and I have never found a game that kind of recalled that while giving me something new. Songs of conquest is a really fun evolution.

No gameplay spoilers ahead.

-The graphics are really pretty and everything moves smoothly, animations are fast but not too sped up and all of them can be skipped.
-THERE ARE BARD SONGS AS CUTSCENES. Such a nice touch. Also the music in general is just awesome.
-The battles are structured and work like Heroes but other than being faster and having have great animation they have some new mechanics that are really interesting, such as terrain differences that give this or that advantage/disadvantage to units. The spells are also different, but it's too long to explain, look it up!
-The story imo is quite immersive. You play as this badass woman-knight with badass lines. All playable side characters (the ones that in Heroes would have been, well, your heroes) have unique lines and interact with your main hero through the scenarios.
-It gets appropriately hard appropriately fast. As expected, only the first few scenarios are run-through. The rest punished me hard for wasting time!

First impressions after 15 or so hours played, I've only tried the campaigns. This game seems a masterpiece. I'm in awe at how they've managed to reinvent the HoMM formula, adding so much more complexity to battles without losing any of the charm. The spell system is ingenious and so much fun. The devs are communicating with the fans here and on Reddit which is important, too. I'm also thankful that it's available on mac.

Lavapotion has done an excellent job with this, and I hope Songs of Conquest takes off for them. My main wish for the full release is just ... more campaign content, I guess?

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've never played the original Heroes of Might and Magic series so this is legit a fresh look at this game.

It has promise. That's the best I can tell you.

The game comes with 13 maps that you can't edit if you don't want to play the Campaign mode.

If you download maps off of Mod.IO you can't edit them until you go into the game files and copy and past the map file into the file you make for editing maps. No reason for that to be a thing that's a basic function of the map editor why do the maps not go into a folder the editor can read by default?

The AI is terrible. To show off how terrible I had a level 16 hero with a massive army and TWO of the AI's level 3 or less heroes with armies that had absolutely no chance ATTACKED me in one turn. They just ran right into me. The AI in battle prioritizes doing damage and killing units. It doesn't care if it's targeting a unit that isn't a threat it will let your super OP ranged units bombard it and focus on killing weaker units that don't really threaten it. It just cares about dealing damage. That's all.

The Heroes themselves are really unbalanced. A high level caster focused on using the game's magic system can outright destroy entire armies with minimal effort. You can spam multiple spells a turn and it's really, really cheesy. In PVP this can essentially boil down to ""I won because I went first and blew all my spells"" which makes pvp really a moot point.

Some of the spells have wordings that a player could easily misunderstand. If a spell says it damages all Troops it means all troops INCLUDING yours. If a spell says it can jump to multiple troops, it means ALL troops INCLUDING yours. If it gives you two attacks the unit will just blow both if the target survives the first hit even if said target was so mortally wounded it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The spell that pushes things away from you is stopped by the first damage dealing thing the unit is pushed into INCLUDING a CLOUD. Why would I assume the spell that throws a dragon 20 tiles backwards would be stopped by a CLOUD?

To wrap this up the towns also have no real defense at all. They have no baseline defenders and the defense buildings are entirely a waste of time. Defending anything is totally pointless. I ended a game where I attacked the AI's main city and it was being defended by ONE RAT. A SINGLE RAT.

I didn't even know what to make of that.

Long story short the art style is nice, but the gameplay boils down to a random smattering of magic casts against a really inept AI enemy. I understand it's in EA but they want $30 for this game and it's just not worth that in the state that it's in. Maybe some updates will fix that but until that happens I can just review what I have and what I have is not worth $30.";23.8;0.0;10.0;157.0;Posted: 22 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, I've been waiting for this game for a few years. I've just finished the first campaign and in general it has a few key issues. But let's start with...

The Good:
- Art style is nice. Not the best, but nice. Pixel art is not my thing but models and animations are acceptable. The problem though, due to being pixel art, nothing is too clear (compared to Heroes games, especially Heroes 3). On the adventure map, a lot of buildings are non-descriptive or non-characteristic. But still, they look nice.
- Flow of the game in general is quite good. When you get used to the mechanics, like recruiting units instantly from your other towns with Rally Point or casting unlimited amount of spells per turn is bit different but kinda welcome. The unlimited casting thing has a down side but I'll get to that in a minute.

The Meh:
- Factions are... not very special. Main faction in the first campaign is literally Castle/Haven with a twist. Necros are as expected, skellies and rats. Mercenary faction is pretty bland from what I've seen so far. I think there is also a Fortress faction but I haven't seen much from them yet. They are mostly in the second campaign I think.
- Units are not specifically special either. The game has a unit based mana mechanic, which is different. Each unit has a mana type and they generate that when their turn comes up in combat. Then your hero can cast spells with those mana types (think like MtG mana but creatures generate the mana instead of lands). From what I understand, there are Might and Magic hero types (and we obviously had the Might hero as our main hero in the first campaign) and once again, Might focused heroes suck a bit. More to that later.

The Succ:
- The absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ imbalance, especially in the campaign. Even after the latest patch to balance it out, enemy heroes in the last mission of the Castle faction has almost infinite amount of units. I had to restart the mission twice, took parts of the map inch by inch, lost some parts and tried to retake to lost towns again and again... It took literally 10 hours to finish the last mission. I might've got cancer while trying to finish that last mission.

PS: If you can manage to sneak in your hero to the top leftmost town and kill the guy in front of the town, it's over. But enemy's wandering heroes are literal gods with constantly fully stacked armies, sooo good luck.

- The spellcasting. I mentioned this a couple of times but as different and refreshing as it is, unlimited spell casting becomes absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Magic focused heroes. You can get hit with 2 Armaggedon, 2-3 chain lightning and a few other fireball-like spells at the same time and lose every single unit while winning. While Magic heroes can do this, Might heroes can... boost troop defences a bit, give a little bit of initiative or grant an extra turn to a unit (which is probably the saving grace of Might heroes).
- Autosave/Battle Save system: After playing Heroes 3 HD+ for years, I really got used to the battle save that let's me replay a battle or take me to the exact moment before I engage the enemy. This game however, doesn't even have a decent Autosave feature. To be fair, it DOES autosave but it usually take you a few turns before, which you need to replay again. I can't even remember how many times I had to replay a ♥♥♥♥ ton of turns just because I forgot to make a quick save. I even had to play a few major battles just because of a simple mistake I made later and forgot to make a manual save. Btw, yes, the game allows you to customize the number of autosaves and autosave frequency in the Options menu but it still doesn't fix anything.

In short... This game has a lot of potential to be a very good one. It may not be a classic like Heroes 3 but it won't be forgotten quickly by the fans of the genre, that's for sure. BUT, I still can't recommend the game in this EA state. It still has a lot of balancing issues and some of the features should be reworked. I'll wait for the full release and if the issues get fixed, I'll probably recommend it then.";15.8;0.0;9.0;868.0;Posted: May 20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I would give this game proper chance, but the thing that killed all my joy is the UI.

I loathe modern games that don’t have proper UI settings. This game has none. Everything is so darn small, that it takes real effort to see text, and clicking requires extra effort. Why is minimap so miniscule? It’s almost useless. Why resource numbers are in font size 6? Why is the troop roster so tiny?

It’s infuriating.

Now, I did not play that much, because I don’t think this game is worth my time at its current state or at the current price tag. Maybe I’ll pick this up on later date at sale, after the full release, if the game gets proper UI settings.

Combat is mediocre plus. I can’t really see myself engaged in it for long run, but it’s alright. I have seen and played much worse. It’s fast which is nice for MP. But it’s also quite simple which can be a good or bad thing, depending on person to person. AI seemed passable. I liked the deployment system of troops at the beginning battles. It felt impactful for the outcome of the battle. Magic system was different, I really don’t know if it was good or bad. Troop limits, well I can’t really say.

Ranged units seemed absolutely overpowered. Wielders (Game’s heroes/commanders) were static boosts, and they felt void and flavourless. Artifacts also felt bland. Campaign apparently is super short or so I heard, which is a bummer.";1.7;0.0;8.0;185.0;Posted: May 18

Not in a very balanced state at the moment. The difficulty curve when you get to mission 4 Death to diplomacy is ridiculous. They have 3 wielders rock up at the same time with armies far greater than you can get just one. Your spells are ""Give your dudes +10 defence"". Their spells are ""Nuke your side of the battlefield"".

I'll give it another go when there's some balance patches. It's a fun game and it has a lot of potential but for now it's completely lopsided.

Edit: Also the auto resolve battle is awful. I send my main wielder into an ""easy"" battle and they get wrecked.";10.2;0.0;3.0;635.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR polished turd is, unfortunately, still more or less a turd. I'm not hating, but a LOT of reviews for this game are positive only due to HoMM nostalgia. Game has potential, but it's not as ready as some would make you think.

As a longtimed Heroes series fan and someone who was really looking forward to this game I'll be first to say: the spirit of HoMM3 is strong in this one. Even though I'm not a fan of pixelart (HoMM3 sprites still look better than those in this game), I have to admit the level of polish is quite good. Music is especially well made. Base gameplay is solid and you can feel a heart put into creation process.
Should you be rushing to buy this one then? No.

Despite being a small game with pixelart graphics, it struggles with keeping consistent fps even on high end hardware.
Campaigns are short and really not that creative in terms of a plot. Sure, it's a turnbase strategy, but even latest Heroes incarnations could put a good story.
Balance is all over the place, game heavily promotes magic casting, basically forcing you to cast at every possible turn and invest in magic oriented skills. If you won't do so, you'll be blasted to pieces by an AI wielder shooting offensive spells faster than AR-15. Example: in the first campaign you encounter a setup with AI not only starting with more cities (that's expected) but also with a sh*tton of magic resource generators meaning fighting their wielders is a suicide until you patiently try to remove all those external generators first. Or you can simply run 2-3 armies at once into enemy wielder to secure a victory and leave yourself open to attacks from other enemy armies. Fun times. Did I mention that AI has apparently unlimited resources, almost instatly brinding back defeated wielders and coughing up army after army?
Speaking of armies - some units have clear advantages over their counterparts, which you'll discover only a few hours into the gameplay.
Battlefields size is an illusion, you'll get 1 turn to setup your units before an actual engagement and that's if you're lucky. This one might not be a downside for everyone but for me - in tactical turnbased game, it's a huge no-no. If we want things to get fast, we have combat speed and autoresolve for that.
That brings us to buildings. While the whole system works quite nice, some buildings have requirements stating that other, usually rather useless building (e.g. lumbermill) is erected first. The thing is, once you build the building you want, you can simply destroy the required building freeing the space and getting resources back. What's the point here, delaying me 1-2 turns longer?

I'll wait for it to exit EA, then we'll see about changing this review. Good news is - most of problems are a matter of tweaks and adding content, not rebulding the core of gameplay so there's a solid chance the game will come up good.";6.5;0.0;15.0;609.0;Posted: 18 May

A bit basic/simple at the moment, but certainly has potential.

Here's my experience in a nutshell:

- Collect nearby resources and build up the town
- Get walled by neutral camps blockading the way out
- End turn until I can build up an army
- Bash my way through neutral camps
- Collect nearby resources and build up the town
- Get walled by neutral camps blockading the way out
- End turn until I can build up an army
- Bash my way through neutral camps
etc.

Combat is extremely simplistic. You sit and wait for the AI to approach and the side with bigger numbers wins. There's two unit types -- ranged and melees. They all play the same. Spells exist... I guess? There's too few of them to really care. None of them impressed me. The wielders are figureheads that don't actually fight which makes fighting enemy wielders not much different than neutral camps. There's just... no variety. No strategy. Just a war of attrition.";1.8;0.0;6.0;82.0;Posted: May 21

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Like someone who had never played the genre before tried to recreate Heroes and Might and Magic 3 based off a description. Plays a lot like classic HOMM games with some modern conveniences, but then just lacks in gameplay depth. Hero upgrade trees are really boring and uninspired (Just straightforward increases to numbers, no new abilities or creative things to do), the idea behind gating larger armies behind hero level is just stupid, especially making you choose between army upgrades and size. In the time I played I found no inspiration to keep playing and exploring the game as it just didn't seem that interesting.

All it really made me want to do was reinstall HOMM 3 and relive the good old days.";3.9;0.0;8.0;259.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Eh, there's a decent chance this is the very normal barrier to entry with strategy games kicking my ass, and not as much the game's fault, but it ends up feeling brutally hard very suddenly, and hasn't done a very good job teaching me what the hell I can actually do about it. There is a non-zero chance that, just like XCOM Enemy Unknown made me ragequit and absolutely hate it more than a few times before I learned how to play it properly and it became one of my favorite games ever, that a few months from now I'm going to really hit the vibe and love this game, and this review will be re-written if that happens. Nah, ♥♥♥♥ this game.

The art, music, and general artistry of this game are an absolute home run- this is some good freaking strategy game pixel art: The spooky monsters are are weird and awesome as they ought to be, the background music is immersive and stylish without drawing attention to itself when you don't want it to, there is a HELL of a lot of good game here that I really enjoy. This game has a hell of a charisma.

The Strategy layer is interesting but doesn't feel like a 4x game Brick wall you're at a loss to comprehend, and the tactical-level fights are fun in their own right, a mis-step I've seen way too many strategy games fail at. I start up games, either campaign levels or skirmishes, and I have a blast getting a game on its feet, exploring the map, finding resources, fighting Wild opponents and trying to build my little Empire. That part of the game is , do not under any circumstances come away from this review thinking I don't think there's a good game here, but I play that part of the game, I explore, I enjoy myself, and then my actual opponents show up and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piledrive me into the dirt and I have no idea how they're this strong yet, or how I'm supposed to be able to defend against them on equal footing.

If someone tells you they love this game and will be playing it for the next decade, I would believe them: But that means they somehow figured out how to get past the learning curve, and the game itself is not up to the task of teaching you. The tutorial campaign beat the snot out of me at the end, Skirmishes against the easiest AI crushed me into the dirt at the end, I don't know what the hell else I'm supposed to do to learn this game, because I'm not being taught, just punished for not already knowing how to win.

Edit: Been trying more, and I'm honestly only angrier. Good armies are so much stronger than absolutely anything you can put together on short notice that playing this game is an exercise in just waiting until you learn you're about to loose half your empire because 1 enemy showed up who's ready to actually fight you, and you're just ♥♥♥♥♥♥, no counterplay, no chances, nothing you can do about it. If you get lucky and your good armies are in position when their good armies show up, the game is actually fun. But if your good armies are on opposite fronts, you just burn to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ground together and there's nothing either of you can do to stop it. I rescind the suggestion that it might grow on me: ♥♥♥♥ this game.";11.2;0.0;4.0;151.0;Posted: May 18

Basically, what most Turn-Based Strategy purists are saying on their negative reviews.

The game is pretty quick, it seems like the developers have focused more on creating a game that works for streams rather than a complex strategical game. I don't think this issue will be addressed as it's a core problem with the game's foundation.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
in general, game development seems more marketing-driven, very little effort was put into actual game design (even graphic design is questionable)

- there are original mechanics, but judging them is subjective, skipping this. I may say only that spell set which you will you will be limited anyway, so do not expect a variety of ways to play
- graphics is so bad that they had to add a button to highlight interactive objects (in case you take an important object for a pile of garbage). in general graphics and UI is made to look good on a screenshots
- they haven't played first campaign and did not know how difficult the last mission is, had to nerf every enemy in the last mission
- AI is incredibly stupid, keeps attacking your hero every time, it does not matter if it has a much smaller army (even manages to distribute it between all heroes, to it is much easier to defeat two smaller armies in one turn then one big)
- there is no strategy, no way to avoid army losses, you just smash your army into everything, make up for losses and repeat. if you decide to form a range units army there are +75% range protection spell, a lot of units which have 50% range defense and very small battlefield which may be crossed in two turns
- skills are very unbalanced, as an archer you better pray to get +1 range at level 8 then useless +hp
- there is no actual way to speed up animation of units, for heroes you have to click another time to instantly teleport hero to a destination, basically you have to make additional click every time or waste your time

Gorgeous art marred by repetitive dull combat, half-arsed, uninteresting magic system and a world-map that trades meaningful exploration for a mobile-like clickathon as you meander from area to area aggressively clicking on whatever interesting sprites are in your way.

I was lured in by the comparisons to HOMM but this has none of the depth. Anyone making favourable comparisons or even stating this is better than HOMM 2/3 has obviously never played them. Songs of Conquest is more like Kings Bounty, albeit simplified.";1.5;0.0;10.0;201.0;Posted: May 16

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I was really excited about this game, which is why this was a hard one to downvote. Unfortunately, this game suffers from a range of bad and DELIBERATE design decisions which sadly make it just a mediocre nice try and a forgettable experience.

Some of the major bad design decisions include:
1) unit stack caps! seriously, what the hell? who ever thought that this was ever even a remotely good idea?
2) no wait and defend in battles, you basically just throw the two armies at each other with close to no strategy
3) the spell variety is severely lacking, and the spells, overall, have negligible impact
4) the artefact system is shallow and it allows for very limited builds; this also means that the best-in-slot items are very clear-cut and that strategically creating an impactful build around the situational needs of the moment is not really an option

I might add more items to this list as I keep playing, however, so far, the above are enough for me to say that this title has completely failed to meet the expectations that it built up by labelling itself the spiritual successor of HOMM3, which could not be further away from the truth. I suppose I'll continue to stick to Horn Of The Abyss.

UPDATE: Please upvote my suggestion to have unit stack caps removed and the command system reworked: https://songsofconquest.featureupvote.com/suggestions/301083/remove-unit-stack-caps-rework-the-command-system.";1.6;0.0;6.0;1004.0;Posted: May 18

The game has a great foundation but $30 for a game that is, at this stage extremely unbalanced, has made me regret this purchase. If you like turned based RPG style games, you will play long enough to be disqualified for a refund and then discover the games difficulty jumps from 5 to 10. I did not actually play for 20 hours, I fell asleep and left the computer on, but I would have easily passed the 2 hour mark.

So if you're a HARDCORE GAMER who wants to watch at all the YouTube tutorials just to figure out how to beat the first campaign on ""normal"" difficulty, then this is the game for you.";19.1;0.0;6.0;68.0;Posted: May 17

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Really fun. However, it'll be more fun when modding tools comes into it. Personally, I would like a slightly cleaner UI because it looks rough. The new engine is incredible, It is so much easier to run this than the first game with wayyy more units, amazing (I used to be able to run max 20K in 1 but 1.8 Million in this one). More options for graphics is really good. The aiming is still janky as all hell and a slight incline makes shooting pointless. Aim should always personally be spot on 95% of the time or at least 90% of the time, not 80% as standard. Health points are really weird because soldiers can just rambo through bullet after bullet when in reality, without plates or heavy armour, they can only take 1-5 max before dying. Sound is decent but obviously it's been toned down for rendering purposes so it can sound a little weird but that's really not an issue. Artillery if added in the future should take noise priority regardless for more immersion (possible audio option in the future?). The shooting AI is mostly braindead, rushing into bullets without going prone or taking much if any cover. AI should not have to stop moving in order to attack. Unsure if that's an issue with rendering or not. Grenades for soldiers would be nice. Dynamic health dependant on armour feels realistic and that's great. Attention to detail was a really nice touch in maps and on characters however everyone feels like a clone but again that's probably a rendering feature. a set of 3 versions for each unit with tiny differences would be nice but I don't expect it because of rendering issues potentially. However these are mainly smaller things. The most glaring problem is the ugliest UI I've seen in a game. Other than that it's an incredible game, it feels a little bit like a copy paste with a better engine, but with some new features. added. I'm almost certain this game can thrive.

The underlying engine is fantastic. It'll be really interesting to see where the devs take this. It's just a shame they decided that the editor and the in-game UI were good enough to release. Wait for it to get better before you buy.";13.1;0.0;2.0;283.0;Posted: May 16

So, according to this game, my GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is NOT DX 11.1 compatable! I'm running Windows 7 Professional (because I hate Win 10). It says ""DX 11.1 Test Failed!"" Right... It's clearly DX 11 and DX 12 compatable. No battles will run. Not sure what's going on, when every article I can find on that card states that it's DX 11 and 12 compatable. So, looks like a refund is in order.";0.3;0.0;1.0;145.0;Posted: May 18

VERY basic in its current stage. Will most likely become a lot better but for now, if you buy it, buy it to help the devs, not for the 10 minutes you'll play with it.

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it in its current stage.";0.6;0.0;1.0;191.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
When the first UEBS was published, i was eagerly seeing where the game would head, the concept was great but execution left much to be desired. The performance was not particularly great, starting to seriously lag even with just a few tens of thousands of troops on the field, even with a fairly decent setup. Overall, the game mostly felt like an overglorified stress test, if anything.


It is saddening to see that the second game is not much better so far. While still in early access, somehow i doubt this will ever be that significant of an improvement over the first game.


Pros:

- The game supports much more troops on field than the first one
- Atleast there is an system for making your troops move to a location...


Cons:

- SEVERE lack of unit variety, if you thought the first game was bad, this is much more so. Most factions only have 1-2 troops, more often 1 than 2. The people are not joking, it's just that bad

- While the unit models are improved compared to the old ones, they still leave much to be desired often

- While you can command troops to move to a position, they will squish to this, awkward shaped formation that is so tight, what the guys in the middle can't move

- There is little else you can do to really control your troops

Overall, this game feels about the same as the first one, an overglorified stress test, that may or may not be worth your money. If you weren't a fan of the first game, this one won't blow you away either. It might, inf act, dissapoint you even more.

Wait and see, don't buy atleast yet.";2.2;0.0;5.0;172.0;Posted: May 17

This game seems pretty cool. The reason I don't recommend it is just cuz there's not enough content to release it. Feel kinda ripped off buying it in the first place. Just to release the game in the first place there needs to be 3 times the amount of content. Don't pay for this game. Unless the Devs are paying you it's not worth playing at this time.";2.0;0.0;4.0;221.0;Posted: May 17

A total rip off frankly on the back of the first one
After playing the first one i expected an upgrade - this is a massive step back with frankly very little in it at all and virtually no units for example, its barely past the concept stage really

The options are non existent and i cannot even set my key-binds which was already in place in the first one - why would you not simply carry fundamental basics like the the options menu over ?
Id go so far as to say this new version is currently garbage - you've made yourself look greedy and silly.

Frankly buy the first one and you'll get a much better game - this is a total rip off frankly and i bitterly regret buying it, it isn't anywhere near a product that should have been sold and the delays were clearly because they had done nothing on it at all frankly,
I honestly feel genuinely ripped off.

-Variety of things to do
- Fun with Friends
Cons:
-Toxic community
-Not a good game for a casual, do to having to spend a lotf time just to perfect game mechanics(like recoil)
-has a bit of an issue with cheating but that is actively being worked on
-can be very angry and depressing most of the time
-Issues with Zergs

PVP servers are fun but kind of a grind, but if you want an amazing experience PVE servers is more fun, if you are a new player start with PVE servers and then play PVP you will enjoy PVE better the community servers are amazing.

While I enjoy the game I have several complaints. For one, most players aren't good at the game they either hack or abuse every aspect. The worst aspect is the constant trolling when it is clear you lose a PVP from connection issues or the administers not stopping the cheaters. The game itself is great when it works. It is other people though that ruin the experience. It also is difficult to acquire items early on like guns or explosives to compete. It takes way too much time to get used to the game.";985.2;0.0;0.0;4.0;Posted: May 18

running the game to ♥♥♥♥; every update makes it worse and i honestly don't recommend buying it in the state it's in right now. They constantly make the game less pvp oriented and i sit on my phone for a good 2 hours every wipe because of how boring it gets. If you're more into pve then i'd say go for it, but ark is probably a better option in the survival/pve category. It also has some pay-to-win aspects like the winter hazmat suit (not much.) Vanilla servers take long, boring, job like days to get a satisfying experience and modded is full of corrupted admins that ban you for even showing the slightest amount of skill

I'd always end up running into someone with a machine gun who would just gun me down. All the servers I joined had just been wiped too, and claimed to be noob friendly, but you had guys running in 4-5 man groups with machine guns gunning down newbies who spawned in on the beach.

At first the game seemed like it could be a fun time, It can be pleasant if you join a quieter server or something. The larger public servers have vastly devolved into just people keeping themselves locked to primitive tech and killing newbies off of spawns, It's rather depressing. If you don't have a group, you're better of finding a solo/duo server, the public ones are just awful to play on. For how many bows there are, why can I not make a wooden or metal shield?

Many of the players in the chat are very homophobic, yet will constantly brag about how ""deep"" they went in on boys, the irony is palpable. The chat's on many servers are barely moderated and I can understand, If I read half of the stuff these idiots post on a daily basis, I'd want to die more than I do already.

The fishing is 10/10, it's chill if you do it in a safe zone, It's a great way to wind people up who want to kill you by refusing to leave and fishing for like an hour until they get bored.";80.4;0.0;0.0;295.0;Posted: May 19

The best way to explain my feelings on this game is through a story. So this monster cockroach had taken up residence in my bathroom for like the last year but whenever I tried to catch him he would always slip my grasp. About a week ago I finally corner the bastard in a cartoon box. I find a way to maneuver the roach into the toilet without wasting any time, and a sense of victory washes over me. But is this enough? Oh hell no I want this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to suffer. I decide I'm going to drop a load on him before I flush him, a dishonorable sendoff. So I get on the toilet and start going to work. It starts coming out and this is one solid log I had been holding on to for about half an hour I aim by looking through my legs, all is going well, the log is right on coarse. Eventually it makes contact, and this is when all hell breaks lose. The roach goes full rambo and climbs UP MY ♥♥♥♥ towards my butthole! I panic and start jumping around like a 50's housewife who just spotted a rat. Mind you my log hadn't been broken yet so I'm spreading that ♥♥♥♥ all over the bathroom in the process. Best part? The little bastard got away. Now I'm sitting on my computer procrastinating cleaning my bathroom covered in fecal matter.

Too many scripters and hackers. For a full loot game things like this are more detrimental than normal. Having both recoil and bullet spread at the same time only adds to the ease of script advantage while also making the skill curve far less friendly for newer players. It's a game with a lot of potential but falls short when it comes to combat, gunplay, and anti cheat.";1319.7;0.0;0.0;65.0;Posted: May 22

Where could I even start? Rust is made by the same company as Garry's Mod, which if you know anything about what hot garbage that game is you can already expect Rust. It's unresponsive, dated, the anticheat doesn't do anything. Ignoring all those fatal flaws, the core gameplay centers on building a base and stockpile of gear in order to even play. How this works is unless you play the hour a server resets (wipes) it is just you with middling melee vs dozens of guys with guns who will hunt you to the end of the earth even if you have nothing, because they enjoy the kill. It's a great game for unemployed sociopaths and streamers (same thing).";14.0;0.0;0.0;153.0;Posted: May 20

Avoid.
It's not a game, it's a front for numerous skin gambling websites for minors.
it's malware that runs crypto mining programs in the back ground.
It's an un-optimised mess with severe memory leaks.

Instead of adressing these ''issues'', Facepunch just keeps adding more useless transport options (Cars, ziplines, Trains) that become obsolete as soon as the novelty wears off.

No character creator.
The game just hands you a randomised character. (in my case: a bad cgi bald asian lady)
Apparently, wanting to play a toon that resembles yourself irl makes you a racist according to Facepunch.
The main reason facepunch turned off ''family sharing'' is that they want you to keep buying the game on alt-Steam accounts until you get the character you like.

It's a scam and it shouldn't be allowed on Steam.";163.4;0.0;0.0;3.0;Posted: May 17

You will need good graphic card & I7 to really enjoy the graphics but it will not help u to win the game.

Personally I like CSGO more than any other FPS and here is why (This is totally my opinion and may be different for you too so be easy lol)

1. Unlike COD, Halo, Battlefield, ect... players actually have a brain and use it towards sticking together and making sure they clear the round and aren't running around like headless ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to get the most kills.

2. You feel really competitive unlike any other game I have personally played (coming somewhat close to Halo.) And once you start getting better and start to understand where to use which guns or figuring out your favorites, you will splurge on CS for hours.

3. Players are nice and feel as if they got your back, which makes any co-op game a huge plus. you will get a few cheaters here and there since they made the game free way back when and have been struggling with it for years, but when you get a legendary team it makes your day.

Grew up on the Legendary CS1.5... then CS1.6 came... then the CSSource came which was a huge miss, but CSGO was definately a step in the right direction. It isn't as snappy and sharp as the 1.6 was (probably not achievable any more), but it is up there at the top when it comes to play-ability and the overall gameplay experience.

Apart for the inevitable cheater problem (despite VAC doing it best) it is a fun, well balanced multiplayer game which I love to play and I encourage you to play too.";101.3;1.0;0.0;1.0;Posted: May 22

Great competitive game but needs a lot of fixes. Matchmaking algorithm is broken. Anti cheat is so legacy that no one considers it even exists. Work on these to keep the CS legacy going on.

For a new player the experience is hell like, simply because of the trust factor system. New players will get hackers for the first 100 queues.";1002.5;1.0;0.0;28.0;Posted: May 19

Bought a 1200 euro gaming laptop but still cant play this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10-year old game without constant chopping and stuttering, even when I switch all settings to low!
This is the only game I can't play on my laptop! I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ furious! Whoever made this ♥♥♥♥ is either a pretentious bumbling moron or is deliberately throttling certain setups! It's unacceptable in this day and age that a company raking in billions can't make a stable game that's equally accessible to mid-range priced rigs as well as those on the high end. I'm not stumping up 3000 euros for a rig only to be able to play this game casually, just to relax every now and then, and not want to smash my laptop every time I turn the game on. 16GB ram, 6GB video memory, RTX 3060 GPU, i5-10500H CPU, 500 SSD and still not enough to fire up this game and enjoy a stutter-free experience. JUST NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SENSE THAT I CAN'T PLAY A NORMAL MATCh WITH THESE SPECS! We're talking Counter-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Strike, tiny 2D maps and cheap aged VFX effects, you stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!

The game I loved is dead.

Valve care more about skin revenue than fixing ranked competitive matchmaking. It's littered with smurfs, cheaters, and rank mismatches so egregious as a silver that it's impossible to solo queue anymore. I've been playing for two decades, I can tell when a person is a higher skill level than me, and the number of apparently GOD-TIER AIMERS ONE RANK HIGHER THAN ME is completely incomprehensible. Not to mention the sheer number of games I've played against MG, MG2, DMG, LEM, over and over and over again.

The Fire Spirit card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4). It spawns a very fast, area damage, short-ranged Fire Spirit with low hitpoints and moderate damage. It resembles a small chunk of flaming coal. Fire Spirit launches itself at its target when attacking, destroying itself on impact. It is the same as those spawned by the Furnace. A Fire Spirit card costs 1 Elixir to deploy.

The Fire Spirit's area damage is very useful against swarms of weak, small troops like Goblins, Spear Goblins or Minions. However, due to its relatively low health, placing it next to these units will result in it dying before it can attack. Placing the Fire Spirit at a distance allows it to safely deploy.
Against the Mother Witch, you want to place it close to her instead, so that it is killed as part of its attack instead of being killed by the Mother Witch, otherwise she will spawn a Cursed Hog from it.
If timed correctly, a Fire Spirit can damage all the Lava Pups just as they explode from the Lava Hound, defeating them.

Due to this splash, an effective strategy is to pair it with troops that deal high single hit damage but are easily stopped by the small troops mentioned, such as the Mini P.E.K.K.A. and Prince.

The Fire Spirit will connect to a Princess Tower provided it is equivalently leveled. Although it can easily be stopped, its cheap cost often lures out cheap spells and can cause opponents to over-commit Elixir-wise with their defenders. If used at the start of a match, it can also act as a way to tell what deck your opponent is using based on the card that they use to stop the Fire Spirit.
Fire Spirit can compliment pushes effectively due to its good cost-to-damage ratio and fast movement speed. For example, if the player is pushing with a P.E.K.K.A. and Fire Spirit behind and the opponent drops Minions to counter for example, the Fire Spirit drops the health of said units to be finished off by a Zap or cheap ranged units to protect the P.E.K.K.A, letting her continue towards the tower without taking extra damage.
It is most effective with fast moving troops like the Hog Rider, as they will not collide with each other as much during an attack.
A Hog Rider and Fire Spirit combo can make short work of Cannons.
The player can use units to soak it up. For example, the Skeletons or another spirit result in a neutral Elixir trade.
For more Fire Spirit value, a Furnace costs 4 Elixir and can spawn up to 7 Fire Spirits, giving the player almost twice as many Fire Spirits for their Elixir. It can allow for more consistent chip damage to Crown Towers and can bait spells due to its cost. However, the Fire Spirits do not spawn all at once, and its upfront cost is higher, so in a situation where the player needs quick area damage, the Furnace is much less versatile.
Occasionally, it is a good idea to combine the Fire Spirit with spells to defeat certain troops for a low Elixir cost. With a Zap, it can defeat anything up to Wall Breakers, with Arrows, it can defeat anything up to Skeleton Dragons, with Fireball, it can defeat anything up to a Night Witch, and with Lightning, it can defeat anything up to an Inferno Dragon. Use these combinations when you are lacking better counters for these troops or to get a good Elixir trade that would be granted compared to using two Spells.
Pairing the Fire Spirit with Electro Spirit is very effective, as they both cost 1 Elixir, which will only use a total of 2 Elixir. This combination can take out units such as Princess, Minions, Archers, Bomber, Firecracker and can even completely stop a Goblin Barrel with the help of the Princess Tower. This combo can help a lot of decks which try to bait The Log or Arrows, since the combo is very effective against swarms. It is also good on the offensive side, having more damage potential than The Log and can hit air. The player should make sure to deploy the Spirits a short distance from their targets to ensure they can finish deploying and attack successfully.
Although the Fire Spirit’s area damage radius is not enough to completely stop a tower-centered Goblin Barrel, there is still a way to counter the Goblin Barrel with Fire Spirit, although 2 of the Goblins will still get one hit on the tower (240 total damage at tournament standard). Place the Fire Spirit on the tile directly behind the tower, and if timed correctly, the Fire Spirit will push one of the goblins toward the tower, and it will one-shot all 3 goblins. This trick is very precise but can be pulled off consistently with practice. A tip for timing: Place the Fire Spirit at the exact moment when the Goblin Barrel is one tile above the river.";22.5;0.0;0.0;30.0;Posted: May 22

The worst gaming community... 8 out of 10 games are filled with cheaters of all kinds... every game shows how useless is to put hours into this game and specially you will never rank up in solo matchmaking either because of the cheaters, of because the game is so dead that you queue up with people 3/4/5 rank above you. I strongly recommend that people avoid this game. Worst scam in all of gaming. All of the game mechanics is basically based on skins trade.

Some jagoff has been botting in flying scoutsman literally nonstop for two weeks. He'll join with a posse of bots which will kick all human players and then sit there so he can headshot them. It's the only non-prime scoutsman lobby in my region, and it's literally unplayable. Devs are evidently too busy leaking their source code to do anything. But it's a good game bro, if you pay $15 you can get an ugly ass gun skin once a week and maybe you can even play the game, who ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knows dude";18.4;0.0;2.0;80.0;Posted: May 22

Infuriating. The CS:GO Anti-Cheat is pure garbage; It is virtually impossible to go even one day without getting put in a lobby with a hacker. Even if you don't get a hacker, rando teammates usually play worse than the bots; You'll often go spectate someone just to see them stare at the floor or wall. Furthermore, this game is the worse thing to happen to my internet since Spectrum; At least twice a game, everyone will be glitching around because I suddenly have a ping of 240 despite the internet being fine in any other game.

The gameplay is decent, game modes are fun and fast paced, but the player base is horrendous. Came back to play a match after a year break and I get kicked out from a casual game (don't be the last guy left on the team, if you don't win you'll get kicked). The player base was never very friendly anyway, but this does it for me. Okay, I'm done venting.";211.5;0.0;0.0;38.0;Posted: May 22
