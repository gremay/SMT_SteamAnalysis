EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Good game, i feel the graphic's vibe of ""into the breach"" game, and the grid map remind me of Super Robot Wars (SRW) Series, The dev offer a bit different rules of the card game (without discarded game, but always randomly spawn card from the deck), but hey, that's the challenge..

Suggestion from me as the game is still alpha, need more interactive and interesting event..

I dont regret to bought this, and still wait for the great development from the dev..";10.9;1.0;0.0;127.0;Posted: September 12, 2021

Often absolutely dependent on luck in the first turn without any reshuffle options, especially encounters with multiple units, not having shield cards usually means game over.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A nice game which lacks some polish at the moment. You have too little control over the gameplay as the few possible combos depend on getting the required cards by luck. The replay factor needs improvement, too, as you can only unlock 3(4?) ship hulls but no powerfull cards or something similiar for the next round. Currently there are only a few (5?) levels/star systems which make the game very short. Nevertheless I enjoyed it and hope for a DLC and the needed improvements.";5.7;1.0;0.0;1289.0;Posted: August 23, 2020

Super Short Review:
This game is an absolute gem and well worth picking up if you enjoy deck-building and space-themed strategy.

Slightly Longer Review:
If you enjoy Slay The Spire or similar deck-building games and you have played space-themed titles like Eve Online and Elite Dangerous... oh boy, will you enjoy this game.

It's a super well polished approach to the genre, featuring beautiful pixel art, a catchy soundtrack and great game design. The hints of lore in this Alpha version already have me intrigued about all the ""races"" and very distinguishable ship designs, the ""oomph"" of card synergy power is very well executed, the feeling of challenge and the achievement when you beat each of the bosses is on point and it even had me gasping at certain random encounters (that I won't spoil) I did not expect, but have left me further intrigued.

I have only managed to collect a single ""legendary"" grade card so far but it already had me working to build a deck around it and I could not put the game down until I managed to unlock all the ships available so far and take them for a spin.

Overall, I am very eager to continue playing and for all the ways I can see this game growing towards its 1.0 release. I can estimate that the content in this current build will probably have me playing it for around 10 hours, but I will definitely follow its development for the chance to play more For The Warp.

A great game that will only get exponentially better as it gets more content.";8.1;1.0;2.0;171.0;Posted: April 9, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I originally bought this game on itch.io in December, back when it was in alpha 0.2.3, so I have a lot more hours in the game than what is reflected on Steam. It's been really cool to see how much work the devs have put into it in just a few short months.

In a nutshell, FTW is a roguelike where you move a spaceship through several sectors of a galaxy toward a goal, sort of like FTL, but the combat uses cards (which are shaped like 3.5 inch floppies and are cute as hell) with different skills and effects, similar to Slay the Spire. Because the loot and maps are randomized, each game is unique and there are many different play styles you can go for in your deck. So, I think it has a good amount of replay value, even in this early alpha stage of development.

I love the pixel art. I love the music and hope they add more. I love the little references (""twisted firestarter"") and the quirkiness of some of the enemies. It's a fun game and I appreciate the insane amount of work they've put into it in just the three or so months since I bought it.

At this point (alpha 0.5.0) my biggest complaint is money. It's too easy to acquire and that makes it too easy to buy a lot of overpowered equipment at shops. I think either money should be more rare, or that loot should get progressively more expensive. That, I think, would help balance the game and make it more difficult. It's a roguelike, after all. It's supposed to be hard! Aside from that, I think they've got a good thing going here and I look forward to seeing what else they do with it in future builds.";16.1;1.0;0.0;154.0;Posted: March 29, 2020

This game reminds me of the good times I had in Slay the Spire. If you like deckbuilding, this is a great game for you. Spire was the first game that got me into deckbuilding, but it felt too rigid and linear. This one gives a lot more path choices, and as far as strats/builds go it feels more flexible.";8.7;1.0;0.0;144.0;Posted: March 31

For the warp is awesome!

the team has a lot of future additions planned but even as it is, it's a solid game, every playthrough is different and interesting.

the artwork is awesome, i'm a sucker for pixel graphics and this game sports some of the best.

i'm 60 hours in and i'm sure i'll still feel as enthusiastic about this game in another 60 hours.

if you love turn based games
if you love pixel art
if you love space

buy this.
it's worth every cent. and we need to throw as much money as we can to the devs Massive Galaxy so that they can continue to make games as awesome as this one.

in fact, if you even got as far as reading this review then you already know that you want this game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I love the art style and design of the game. I have beaten the game on hardcore and draft with every ship. The game in its current state is very minimalistic. Each run through you need to eliminate most of the starter cards. Mass Driver is essential for every single deck, this card needs to have a chance to be permanently destroyed each time it is used. I can make perfect draw decks with Mass Driver. The game is very easy simply by getting a few heal cards and getting as many +to max shield cards. What the game lacks most is meaningful interactions with aliens. They need to hire some cartoonists or comic strip writers to make some satirical and fun interactions with aliens. The game is too easy, I can gauranteed win every single run through by farming a zone. This game needs to take a note from Slay the Spire and Hades by adding some scaling difficulty modifiers to keep players challenged and interested. I do recommend this game, but many updates need to come.";120.3;1.0;3.0;130.0;Posted: February 26, 2021

Nice artwork, nice tunes... The only truly negative thing I can say about the game is its overreliance on RNG. I get it's meant to be a ""roguelike"" but the balance or lack thereof is all over the place. I can't begin to tell you the number of runs ended in the first sector because of several clusters of enemies that all spam their attacks and leave you at half or less health past the first encounter; then the sector one enemies that enjoy their 10 ~ 23 damage attacks.

Yes, enemy attack values vary wildly unlike yours which are static. Their 'Burn damage' also pierces/ignores your Shields/Block while yours can't do the same.

That said, it's still entertaining for what it is but if the talk about its balancing or lack of certain elements common to deckbuilders of this kind puts you off, I'd suggest waiting for a sale or watching someone else play it before deciding.";9.8;1.0;0.0;701.0;Posted: April 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For The Warp is a good game in the making. I've put a decent amount of time into it at the time of this review (about 15 hours or so) and I feel like I've seen pretty much everything the game can throw at me by now. There are definitely some cool combos (I personally enjoy the 0 cost discard cards with the 'draw cards and gain energy when you discard' equipment) and fun gameplay but there are definitely some balance issues.

After a few run-thrus, you quickly realize that some strategies are just better than others because the cards needed for those strategies are the best cards. When I get a bad first shop and don't find many useful early cards in the first area, I end up just starting over because my deck doesn't have the defensive capabilities to survive multiple fights in the second phase. If you need specific cards to progress past the early stages of the game (I'm looking at you barrel roll/cloaking device) then what's the point of adopting any other early strategy that doesn't best support these cards?

An example of a game that I think has perfected the 'balance' concept is Slay the Spire. Any strategy can win the game if you are smart about how you play it and get the key cards/relics you need for that strategy. This game can get there, but it definitely needs work. I will say though that it's a good time while you figure it out, but once you've figured out what works and what doesn't it feels a bit stale.

I still think it's worth picking up though as long as the developers are actively making good changes to the game. Being a part of the evolution of a good game is pretty exciting and if you're okay with hitting a few snags here and there, go for it. Just remember that it's still a work in progress.";38.8;1.0;0.0;45.0;Posted: April 1, 2020

The game is pretty well done on the deck building. I also like how there is no discard pile mechanic to the game. Game play itself is literally challenging, depending on your card draws and deck build. The game does a good job on making me think if i should add more cards to the deck or stay with a small deck. I really wish the devs would have some type of controller support to the game though. All in all the game is fluid and really solid.

I lean on the side of recommending this game, however it seems like something about it makes me both love it and hate it. I enjoy the game play and the styling of it makes it enjoyable. But I feel like the art or game play just doesn't fit all together. Its not terrible, but it just seems like its lacking something. Like a song without a chorus. Feels like its got some good versus and its going somewhere, but it just doesn't feel complete.

I'd definitely keep this game on deck if you're on the fence about getting it, but if you feel like scratching an itch for some card battling then maybe this will be your scratch post.";0.4;1.0;0.0;816.0;Posted: March 30

This one is tough for me and may come across as a negative review, but it really isn't. I absolutely adore the overall idea of this game. A spaceship version of Slay the Spire? Hell yes! However, it often feels like it's deliberately holding the player back from having too much fun.

The game ends a zone or two too soon, right when your build is the most fun to play. The Hardcore mode levels up as you play Normal and Draft, but there's no way to level it back down again. It's stuck at Level 10 for me which makes the first zone nearly impossible out the gate. Speaking of Draft mode, it's my favorite, but some ships are just plain better for it than others, which is sad. I wish each ship had more tangible differences than just the amount of hull/shields it starts with. It's also difficult to build an efficient deck without predictable scrapping opportunities. The shop card offerings are very limited and there's no way to sell back excess equipment. I'm often swimming in credits and loaded down in stuff I don't want but can't get rid off. Definitely detracts from the overall fun of the experience.

Is it worth the price? Sure, but I was really hoping for more longevity from it. I'm giving it a recommend because I've had a good deal of fun with it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Also, the game would be PERFECT for Steam Workshop. I can already imagine the awesome mods the community could create.";36.0;1.0;1.0;332.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
FOR THE WARP definitely a game i will be playing for a long time. Its a deck builder where you start out with a bunch of cards which during the course of your journey you can trade or sell for resources such as fuel, new weapons and ship upgrades etc. Card selection is vast and it all makes sense with the science fiction theme and how they play out. Combat is fun where you can win if you play your cards right :) even when it seems the odds against you. Keeping your shields fully charged is very important to prevent physical ship damage. You will meet others in your travels who can provide repairs for something in return or give you fuel when your running low. I think one time someone even did this for free.

When defeating a boss you will unlock a new ship with new gear adding the variety of things that can be done. Maps are areas of space you can cross any way you want while trying to avoid too many hostile encounters as you attempt to get to the warp exit location. The maps are full of random encounters such as distress calls and ruined civilizations where something foreboding happened in the past. You will also come across merchant zones where you can purchase new cards.

Music is good though at the moment i believe there are only like two or three songs. One for exploration and another for combat. Since its early access many are hoping more music will be added.

For the Warp is like many Roguelike Deck builders, but not the addictive properties of games like, Slay the Spire.
By no means, is FtW a bad game. In this Early Access, the game is solid. I think I've only experienced one bug, and could not replicate it (My ship that just disappeared, and could not move).
Cards and interactions with enemies are what you expect. They're balanced. I think I've cleared three runs out of my ten.
Onto their Draft.
One of the best things, is it's auto unlocked. For those of us who love sealed and drafts, Devs, great job.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a large card pool. While each ship starts off with a different deck of cards. Each ship can branch out and do something the others can. With such a small card pool, decks do feel rather similar. I hope as time goes on, more cards are added.

I enjoyed this game quite a bit, enough to play for 30 hours, but I really wish there was more meta progression (and more content!) Ships and difficulty modes are the only unlocks, and I feel it would be much more engaging/addictive if there was something more to unlock, such as different cards or bonuses. The atmosphere is good, and I enjoyed the music and art style for what it is. I did think the giant ""FTW!"" after every battle was kind of childish and annoying, but I got used to it eventually. I'd like to see some different enemies, as on some maps I felt like I was just fighting the same three enemies on every battle (yawn.) The RNG didn't bother me as much as some other people, I felt it added a layer of strategy and use for the hand-manipulating cards. I also liked that you could save mid-run. All in all, if you enjoy roguelike deckbuilders and a space setting, you'll probably have fun with this one for a little while.";32.1;1.0;1.0;522.0;Posted: April 9

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Played the hell out of the demo, enjoyed it
Bought the game when it was released in Early Access
Found the card Mass Driver, which let me thin my deck down to 2 cards - Barrel Roll and Last Resort
Wiped out the last two sectors without taking any damage at all
The last boss set me on fire once, and made me draw one fewer card once, which allowed him to hit me for 7 hp

Overall, the game is enjoyable, but completely unbalanced - long way to go before final release

I'm gonna try the hardcore mode, but i don't expect much out of it - it'll probably have tougher enemies, so it'll be more difficult for me to assemble a dominating build, but the fundamental flaw of plain vanilla game mechanics isn't going anywhere

Also, all the enemies are the same, just different skins and stats, nothing interesting - seen one, seen 'em all

I enjoyed the game for a couple evenings. But devs, please make it more balanced, diverse, and overall more interesting";2.9;1.0;0.0;352.0;Posted: May 23, 2020

If you like the gameplay of ""Slay the spire"" and the scifi setting of ""FTL"" then you'd probably like this game. However, there are a few caveats.

1. VERY glitchy: I have had numerous occasions. HOWEVER, nothing has broken a run (IE, the UI broke, the event stopped working as usual, ect.) without being fixed by quitting to the main menu and just continuing. However, this has reset one event where I got an epic equipment and made it as if it didn't exist.

2. NO EASY STATUS ICON. if you get set on fire, you have to see it on the combat log. otherwise something happens and you wonder ""Why the heck did I lose a card this turn"" or ""Where did that 2 damage come from?""

However, in my time of playing, nothing has hampered the FTL-esque random encounter combat too badly and the combat (other than the occasional glitch that makes shields ""NON"", as well as the status thing.) too heavily.

overall, 7/10. quite fun in short bursts but can be a bit repetitive if playing for longer periods. Needs some updates and bug fixes but overall is fine.";40.0;1.0;0.0;66.0;Posted: April 4

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'd recommend the game, with the caveat that it can be very frustrating, partly due to a few bugs, and how the game currently works.

I really enjoy building a deck, but it does feel too random in how you receive cards and equipment, even how you discard the cards is down to chance encounters - which makes trying to keep a lean deck really hard, unless you want pass on better cards to hold onto lots of weaker ones. Perhaps allowing the player to scrap more than one card at a time between gates, pay to ""refit"" at a shipyard,
(you can do this at big stations, but these are rare, and its very expensive so that only 1 or 2 cards are possible) or simply ""jettison"" equipment (it costs nothing, but you make nothing either) would help?

There are a few bugs:

* Occasionally pop up windows don't disappear - which can obscure the map and your ship, so you can't click to choose a direction (you can use WASD and QEZX as a workaround).
* WASD etc are not disabled when in at a space station, so it's possible to accidentally move, and exit the space station before you've done anything. Which isn't great since the space stations disappear after each visit.

Anyway, I hope that feedback helps make the game better. Despite all of the above I'm looking forward to future updates!";64.5;1.0;0.0;80.0;Posted: January 17, 2021

This game is extremely fun, even for me, someone who is new to this genre. The cards in this game are pretty broken, so it's really fun just to destroy your enemies. Most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive. My only issue is the last ship's deck being drones and shields. While I understand it's suppose to be a defensive play style, it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks, even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card. I would probably buff the shield cards, but it's not a big deal. Overall, a fun game with crucial decision making, wits, and rng.";15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;Posted: April 22, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has a lot of potential. I like its style and base mechanics. But it's hard to really see the good parts in this game right now because of some fairly dire problems:

1. Balance. There doesn't seem to be any kind of ""base rate"" these cards are built on. Like, there's a card that increases shield capacity by 1 for 1 energy. Another card charges shields by 10 for 1 energy. Another card makes a 4/2 drone for 2 energy. There's also a card called ""AI Supremacy"" that gives you 10 shield capacity, 10 shield charges, and 4 4/4 drones. Going by the established rates, this card should cost at least 19 (ignoring the fact that it also gives you all these effects in one card). Instead it costs 3. Yes it's ""mythic""... but that should mean it's maybe twice as good, not 6 or 10 times as good. Having cards this strong makes your strategy and the enemy's strategy irrelevant - you just play your card and win. Things won't be perfectly balanced... but I feel like there could be a better attempt here.

2. Easy Exploits. Like Slay the Spire, it feels like health is a resource that should slowly exhaust through a stage, and most game mechanics here seem to suggest this was the plan. But there's a card that heals you and doesn't ""deactivate"". This means it's easy to kill all but one enemy, shield up, and loop through your deck until you're healed to full. I think there's one for credits too. You shouldn't be able to get these kinds of effects so easily (ie. with a single card and some patience). Learn the lessons of the other games in this space. These cards should exhaust.

3. Do-nothing events. Whatever is in the mysterious crate, don't have it be nothing. Again, I get this is early access... but I've played the game twice, and it feels like I've opened 6 empty crates. Events don't need fancy graphics or something - just placeholder in _something_.

Anyway, if I was you, dear reader, and if I was looking for a game to play now - I'd add this game to my wishlist, and come back to it once it has had a little more time to bake. But you shouldn't forget it, because I think it could be good.";4.6;1.0;252.0;493.0;Posted: 28 March, 2020

this game is super super promising, but there are a couple of run-killing issues with it. The main one being that there sometimes isn't an ""end"" to the game. You can build a deck that makes all the enemies in the final zone completely trivial, and then you can't actually LEAVE that zone because for whatever reason the warp gate is gone.

Once they fix this, and add a little more variety to the encounters (and I do only mean a little) it will be up there with legends of the genre like FTL.";10.6;1.0;0.0;79.0;Posted: January 3, 2021

There isn't much of a story at this time, but as of this writing (alpha 0.6.1) it's very early in it's development.

If you like one of these, you will also like this. The pixel art is nice, the hard combos are fun, and the gameplay is very fluid with clear UI and nice feedback. The game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature. Sometimes the runs are hard, sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo, both are rewarding.
Right now, the content is still less than FTL and StS, but both these game are unusual for the replayability.

Not too shabby, for being early access.

Picture a space-fairing version of Slay the Spire, but without as much content or variation. Since this is the absolutely bare-bones first release of this game in EA, I'll say that there's enough here to make me look forward to the progress the devs make and the certainly, the final product.

Standard card-adventure fare. Start with 3 energy, use a combo of block, attack and status cards, blow up ships and move around a map in search of treasure or death. Nice art style, nice music.

I think this should be 10 bucks. 15 bucks for the full product would be fine, but this is EA and, while fun, the game is still limited in scope.

If you like supporting devs and like card-based games, it's worth your time. If you're in zero rush for something new to check out, you might want to see how often it gets updated before you toss down your money.";35.7;1.0;4.0;964.0;Posted: March 27, 2020

This is a pretty good game. I don't think it's better than pillars of the genre like Slay the Spire, but that's not a fair thing to expect. This game is enjoyable, and the sci-fi theme is a refreshing change from swords and wizards.

The art is fantastic. I really like the style.

Gameplay is solid. If you pay attention, you can find cards that work really well together, and that's the real joy of a deckbuilder.

All in all, I enjoy this game and plan on playing it more. So that's a thumbs up.


I have not seen any of the bugs other users have reported. I don't know if I've just been lucky or if they were all fixed in the 1.01 patch.

My biggest complaints are all UI-related. For example It's not always obvious what just happened. Some enemy attacks have clear animations, many don't. There's a text log in the upper left that I guess is supposed to solve this issue, but solving it visually would have been a lot better.

The map can also get a bit confusing. They put giant arrows on top of the sectors you can travel to, which sometimes makes them hard to see and understand. I don't know why the arrows are even there. We all understand what adjacent squares are. The arrows could probably disappear after the tutorial and it'd be fine.

Those are the kinds of complaints I have. Minor UI stuff. I see that other people are complaining about difficulty or ""RNG"", but those are all about where I expected them to be. I don't expect to beat a game like this on my first couple runs, and that's fine, so long as I have fun while I fail.";53.6;1.0;0.0;386.0;Posted: April 1

This game has a lot of potential. I dig the art style, and I like the gameplay. It can be seen that this is early access, there are some graphical inconsistencies (like loose anything that isn't pixelart from a pixelart game) and balance issues, and some cards doesn't work properly or not at all. Or the description of some cards not accurate, or just not contains enough info.
The ""deckbuilding"" part is strange to me, and this is what I didn't really liked. I can choose to have a card or not, I can hardly get rid of cards that I don't need, if I'm unlucky, I won't get the cards I need the most. So it has a lot of randomness to it. But what would Space RNJesus do? :D He would still recommend it and hope that in the future, the finished game will have more balance, and some more content and he would play through this game again.";50.3;1.0;0.0;266.0;Posted: November 22, 2021

Very impressive early access game. A very good challenge with some new twists from the average deckbuilder (there's no discard pile for one, which means every card in your deck has an equal chance of being selected each turn). This might mean your big card is in your hand every turn or you never see it throughout a combat, or anywhere in between. The only minor issues I've seen are slightly overpowered bosses early in the game and a risk-reward movement system that doesn't quite do what it's intended to do, but the developer is on the message boards and talks to his players so hopefully some of these things will get ironed out over time. Honestly, one of the best early access games I've ever played on Steam and I have every reason to believe it will only get better with time.

Pros:
Good core mechanics, if unpolished and a bit clunky in execution atm.
Good play dynamic with the right additions I could see this being something I would heavily play and return to later; not sure if it has the full potential of FTL/Slay the Spire but it could depending on further developments.

Cons:
Feels like it has 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards necessary to make it reasonably dynamic.
Lacks the item variation and customization of Slay the Spire [though if you could upgrade to slot more equipment and/or they added basic ship upgrades of some sort.]
Only system variation seems to be enemies [no FTL environmental dangers, or crew flavor]
Deck randomization does functionally only reward a small deck

Conditional recommendation, buy it on sale.

I've played the game for over 20 hours, and it was fun, but quickly became repetitive, as the majority of cards are meh, so it is too easy to just choose a simple combo and stick to it.

Fuel is functionally unlimited if you take the fuel salvage drone card, which then you can sell your excess to rapidly get to 1,000+ credits and rapidly buy any upgrades and cards.

On the start of the 2nd map I'll spend virtually all of my credits just to cycle through all of the ship upgrades.

Take the cloak card, upgrade your ship with high level shield capacity, take the zero cost card that attacks with -2 max shield capacity, and add a few more if you want, but at that point you are not offered any significant challenge.

I think I just played my last game because I unlocked all of the ships except for one hidden one, the repetition wasn't worth it to play through the rest of the second board.

One big problem is the groups of ships are not varied, so on a given board you will keep facing only a few non-varied groups.

So, if you want something new that is reminiscent of FTL and Halcyon 6, if you get it on sale, maybe you might get 20-50 hours of new feeling fun, after which it will drop off into a grind.";26.5;1.0;0.0;816.0;Posted: September 17, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Alright, I normally don't do reviews on Steam, however this game has made me make an exception. The easiest way for me to describe this game at the time of writing is FTL: Faster Than Light mixed with Slay the Spire with a slight influence from tactical rpg's. That being said, there are a few issues at the moment I have noticed, however it could just be my PC at the moment. First issue is in the intro cut-scene the audio jacks up near the end and transfers into the map. Second issue I found is the random encounter that shows all PoI (Places of Interest) on the map, causing a soft lock, however going to main menu then pressing continue resets the tile and allows you to continue playing. Third issue I found is when you run out of fuel, you click the arrow, the distress beacon dialogue appears in which you lose some credits and gain five fuel.

The combat is good. I like the shield system where you can rollover shields to next turn, unless you have the Kinetic Shield card or something else along those lines, however I will say the GUI during combat is not my friend. The GUI is beautiful, however there are no tool-tips except for equipment. If I ignite the enemy, I have to remember how much ignite is on the enemy, how much damage it might do, etc. I see the icon under the enemy, I just don't have any information to work with regarding that aspect.

Synergies is an interesting concept. I like them to be honest, and with the estimated 80 cards you're more likely to encounter synergy cards. It makes the actual deck-building fun, and you can get some pretty interesting combinations. If you find an Ignite synergy with Nova Strike it's beautiful.

Deck-building: In all honesty, I haven't messed around with this all too much. I have noticed that removing cards from your deck is a much more difficult process than adding cards to the deck. There's a few random encounters that allow you to remove cards, and it's a beautiful sight that makes a grown man cry with joy.

Overall, I would pick this game up if you like FTL and/or Slay the Spire. There's a few things that could deal with a bit of polish or reworking, but otherwise it's a good game.

Really nice sci-fi version of Slay the Spire. I'm pretty burnt on pixel art, to be honest, but the pixel art in this game is very nicely done. Music is fantastic, though there aren't many tracks.

Even at this stage there's probably enough different here from Slay the Spire in cards and the slightly different mechanics that you'll probably find this worth it to pick up even if you have lots of time in Slay the Spire.

Quality of life is already pretty good (only major complaint is that the game doesn't do such a great job of indicating and describing status effects). The only significant problem I have with this game right now is that it is badly in need of balancing as it's much to easy as is.";1.8;1.0;0.0;708.0;Posted: March 31, 2020

I'd say it looks good, it sounds good, and plays good (well) too! The game gives you a-lot of room to plan out strategies and play your own style, though I must say not all of them are treated equally. For example, developing shields on the aylon cruiser (or really any ship that has gone deep into shield strats) does, at-least in my experience, more damage than the heavy destroyer. I could understand game-development wise if the HD was meant to be a ""challenge"" ship, but c'mon, a shield focused ship with supposedly weaker firepower is out-damaging a [Heavy] [Destroyer]? And don't get me started on the *survivability. (I'll give you a hint, the Aylon has a starting shield capacity of 45 if you include it's starting equipment, while the Destroyer has nothing besides a card that heals 8 hp once per combat.) Besides that personal gripe of mine, the game is superbly enjoyable, even on hardcore difficulty. P.s., I hope this game gets big enough for someone to put the Soulshaven Station (if that -is- it's name) theme out there, because that was Spelunky-shop levels of smooth.

IN A WORD: MAYBE
IN A NUTSHELL:
WHAT TO EXPECT:
Indie made. Space-faring roguelike. Futuristic sci-fi setting. Procedurally generated 2.5D star map. Turn-based strategic exploration. 2D side-on, turn-based card battler. Ship vs ship tactical combat. Session only deck-building. Requires constant deck management. RNG can cause heavy imbalance. Imbalance makes it very challenging. Quality pixel graphics & art. Matched by synth-pop soundtrack. Short on content. Some variety of components. Made to be replayable. Singleplayer only







For the Warp provided a mixed experience which has some surprisingly involved card-driven space combat. However, the hefty use of RNG gives it an unbalanced nature. One that is further complicated by a lack of mechanisms to limit its impact. Some gamers may find its content on the low side, but it has been made to be replayed. Very likely the reason for its steep difficulty curve.















For the Warp is a well made but unbalanced game. Strategic gameplay is good but could do with a few more additions and added variation. Tactical combat is at times an enjoyable experience with several viable strategies and synergies available. However, the substance deck-building possesses is affected by a level of RNG that causes its overall difficulty to rise steeply, detrimentally impacting balance.

This results in a frustrating experience which is why its rating falls from being worthwhile to a purchase, though only just.";17.5;1.0;21.0;923.0;Posted: 10 April

You can definitely tell that this is still in early access based on the balance, card variety, and viable strategies. That said, I've had a blast so far and am looking forward to see what gets added, adjusted, and built up in the future.

Follow-on edit: After another 5 hours or so and a few updates to the game, I can definitely say For the Warp is worth picking up. There are definitely things that need to get fleshed out and improved (I'm still not sure how to make the drone-based ship work for me), but it is clear that they're moving in a positive direction.

Edit #3: A few more updates have improved the balance I think, at least while going through the systems. There is still a bit of an issue around whether you can lose a good chunk of health on the first turn if you get a bad draw/enemy intentions. Then again, bad luck is an element of this sort of game so I can't really fault them too much for it. The only place where it really becomes a problem is bosses as a couple of the later ones can take nearly 50% of your HP.";25.1;1.0;1.0;267.0;Posted: April 7, 2020

Short but sweet little space deckbuilder. I fail to see the rouglelike/lite aspect (as different ships unlock when you defeat stage bosses), but that's really not a concern.

There is virtually no story here, so those wanting an in-depth or even light story as you crush your enemies won't find one here. This has more potential, and I hope that the developer does seek out more recommendations before official launch.

This is a tentative recommendation.
Like many others have said, the game is fun but some things just don't work as you'd expect.
It's less a deck-builder and more a card pool-builder - you have discard & draw mechanics, but cards don't play in any sort of deck order. You can draw the same card in every hand, and never see others even over many turns.
The ability to explore sectors is cool, but it's not very useful and can encourage you to time-waste. Having played this I can understand why FTL has an enemy fleet chasing you. It's quite possible to become self-sufficient (gaining fuel with every battle & self-repairing) and clean out an entire sector, but there's little value to doing so - you'll have loads of money without anything useful to spend it on and just see the same two groups of enemies over and over.";36.3;1.0;15.0;693.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

Fun, and actually has an interesting design.
That being said it's still unbalanced in alpha, its incredibly easy to force a build without consequence due to the enemies lacking enough impact.

I really enjoyed their deck design having no discard pool; you draw and discard to the same pool.
Even though there are a lot of crazy loops you can pull off, the number of cards you play is limited based on the number of cards in your original deck.

This means you can place higher value on cards that dissipate during the fight as it allows your refined combo deck more cards to play.

It would be interesting to see some balance around this aspect of the game via enemy auras and debuffs.";10.4;1.0;0.0;276.0;Posted: May 14, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have stated, FTL meets slay the spire.

HUGE potential here. I think a few things need reworked.

1. Balance: jmzero's review goes in depth.

2. No discard pile: this i feel is an odd design choice, since there's no discard pile, all cards used immediately go back to the deck, so attaining any new card is a constant lower percentile of getting any card in your deck on every turn. So you may never see your new card in play...ever. Since the deck is *shuffled* every turn. This is poor design, you cant structure synergy here, as you are constantly threatened to draw the same cards over and over. This just feeds into the balance problem, of ""just grab the most OP cards and scrap the rest""

3. Easy exploits: Again jmzero, nailed most of it. I will add shields (especially after unlocking a particular ship) are VERY exploitable. You can turtle up, create drones forever, and heal any dmg that gets by.

4. All events: now jmzero went over the crates. however, many ? events are lackluster. you find a trader...repair your ship...get fuel...sell fuel...etc. the only promising one is the temple ruins, but even that is just a choice of getting more credits at expense of fuel and hp, 5 times. Also to add to the crate, it doesn't help that the literal ""do-nothing"" iteration of that event can soft-lock the game!! (had it happen twice where the pop up doesn't go away ever, the event never ends, and i have to alt F4

4a. Slow-event handling: any pop-up, event, etc. is just slow to show up or finish.

even with these issues i can recommend this considering the alpha state. Potential buyers, i would say if you like FTL and slay the spire and want to support the devs, go for it, otherwise, wishlist it and wait.";9.3;1.0;36.0;292.0;Posted: 27 July, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For an early alpha build, this game shows a tremendous amount of potential! I truly don't understand the recent knee-jerk reviews causing this to have a 'Mixed' rating, because as a huge fan of both StS and FTL I can assure potential players that this game is on the right track. Probably the same whiny crowd that complains about ""too much RNG"" (it's not, you just suck.)

WHAT IT GETS RIGHT:
1. The feel of both Slay the Spire & FTL at the same time.
2. Pick up and Play feel, no annoyingly long tutorial
3. Great art & sound (even if fairly repetitive, which can be forgiven at this stage of development.)
4. Variety of playable cards already

WHAT NEEDS WORK (IMO):
1. More variety of music (same battle music almost if not every combat)
2. Better indication of status effects (difficult to tell what has debuffed you, what the enemy has done, etc.)
3. Greater selection of cards and actions; as it stands the game is fun but a little repetitive.
4. Greater variety of chance encounters
5. Better animation/draggable cards. I've accidentally used cards I'd not intended because of this.

The above are minor complaints if at all, as I quite like the game and have a lot of faith in the future of it. It could indeed surpass my love for StS if executed properly. As far as recent purchases go, I'm very pleased with this one. If you like StS and/or FTL in any capacity, give this a try.";6.1;1.0;5.0;457.0;Posted: August 19, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
An engaging and well executed sci-fi roguelike deckbuilding card game, where you play as a sort of rogue trader that sees his route cut off when returning with a large shipment of goods (last big score kind of situation). As a result, you have no option but to try to survive by traversing though the galaxy's most dangerous paths.

This game has, simply put, amazing pixel art and music. The mood is perfect for its genre and you will, for certain, sometimes stop just to appreciate it visually.

In terms of gameplay, the card mechanics play as a space battle, based on 4 elements - attack, shield, status effects and deck manipulation. So far I'm really liking the type of synergies you can create between cards and the amount of variation already existing. As for your ship, in this version, you start the game by selecting from only two types of ships, with different characteristics, but more are planned.

To be clear, you can tell that it's an Early Access game from the amount of existing content and a few balancing issues it still has. However, the developer is clearly listening to players and using feedback to improve overall balance (I got the game on itch.io, where he did a soft-launch, to get feedback as soon as possible, for that exact purpose). Furthermore, his roadmap already includes more content and his updates have been quite frequent, always adding new stuff and fixing issues as they arise.

Overall, I'd say the game is very promising and already quite fun. A definite recommend!";9.0;1.0;3.0;206.0;Posted: March 27, 2020

It's a good work in process. It has fixed a lot of the issues it had since launch, and while I don't like the hidden limitation regarding how many cards you can play in one turn, it is a welcomed limitation.

So far, For The Warp doesn't offers much. It lacks character, real content, and a defined story or objective to follow. But it does have a LOT of potential and it is, for the most part, well balanced.

If all you want is a winning strategy, you can try to go for one of three possible decks. Carrier Deck, which is broken as all hell. Inverse Shield Damage deck, which can kill 300hp ships in a single hit later on. And Booster Deck, which is so fun and broken it's not even fair to the enemy. Just remember, look out for synergies and cards that let you draw fast and cheaply. But do whatever you can to get the Barrel Roll card, that's literally the best card in the game, period. With it, you have a 99% certainty to win. Also, keep you decks on a 8-14 cards limit, anything more it becomes useless, anything less, you are left powerless.

All in all, I give it a 8/10.";10.3;1.0;0.0;362.0;Posted: August 10, 2021

Early Access review: mostly entertaining but seems to make no attempt at balance. A balance pass will presumably come before the launch from Early Access (post-Early Access update: nope, no apparent attempts at balance). If the Heart of the Cards smiles on you, you will draw amazing combos for free or not need combos at all due to single-card win conditions. Or occasionally you will roll up to an enemy who will immediately attack for more damage than your hull+shields combined while you draw no defense.

This game has promise and will probably get better, but as of November 2021, it is not a game I can recommend.";5.9;0.0;0.0;1460.0;Posted: November 27, 2021

Way too short and it's not just for the game being in Early Access. I don't see much that could be put into this.
This game has great mechanics, card creation, kinda nice map movement although it's not my favorite, but what bothers me most is time you can play it. Taking similar titles like Faster than light or Into the Breach they give you much more ""replay-ability""
Not taking into considaration Slay the Spire which I'm not going to say this game is based on, but is in similar style yet it makes you play over and over again.

Overall Very nice game but price - play-time ratio is not worth it. I really wish I'm wrong here and devs have some ways like better campain in plan. I would really look forward that";3.3;0.0;3.0;72.0;Posted: August 17, 2020

This game is far too barebones currently. There is no real meaningfull synergy. The best way to beat the game is to simply remove cards from your starting deck so that you can fill it with cards that cost 0 and draws 1. It has cards that are too strong like reversing all enemy intents for 0 energy. It becomes more of a war of how much time do you wish to spend on the save rather than how great of play do you do and how interesting of a deck you can build and due to that there are never any exciting moments where you live on a sliver of health. You can tell from the first three battles if this run will be worth doing or not. Its not totally meaningless but it would need quite the rehaul to make it worth playing more than once, let alone pay for it";7.1;0.0;8.0;123.0;Posted: February 7, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There are some interesting concepts here but some weird decisions that, ultimately, I didn't enjoy.

* It's bizarre to me that you start with 3 cards instead of a full deck... No idea why that decision was made (but I'm assuming there is one...?) This means you'll easily take 9-27 damage (probably more later on) without being able to charge your shields or prevent damage (unless you get lucky with your draw on those first three cards) That's my biggest complaint, really. I flew through the first system no problem but died within two encounters on the second system due to this mechanic.

* I enjoyed the sci-fi spaceship/deckbuilding setting and the art is pretty good. Seeing the animations for the corresponding card you played is pretty cool. The backgrounds are bright and colorful and it's always fun to look at. The music was pretty great but seemed to be a bit repetitive?

* 'Burn' (think 'bleed' in other games - damage over time) doesn't take effect until the end of the enemy turn... which is a strange decision as well in my opinion. It doesn't allow the damage to be a real 'game-changer'. You'll take the enemy's attacks and THEN they die... which really hurts your momentum on a run since your HP carries over.

To be fair, I only played this for about 0.4 hours before dying and deciding I didn't enjoy it. It's possible that the game continues to open up as you progress (as deck-building games usually do) I want to like this game and will definitely keep an eye on it as it continues to progress through early access. If you like this genre of game you might really vibe with it... I'm sure I'll pick it up again in the future but I don't think it's something I want to play just yet.";0.4;0.0;0.0;509.0;Posted: September 14, 2021

Like other negative reviews, power scaling is strange and basic survival past the first round or two seems to be based on luck if you get shield capacity and energy.
The battles are long and enemies are mostly uninteresting. You just slug away at each other taking turns recharging shields and taking shots.

Disappointing. Some builds of the game I couldn't even play because of technical issues (aspect ratio/screen region problems, couldn't detect inputs etc.), but beyond that the game design has very large flaws. There is no disincentive for going to every single square and fighting every single enemy, which makes the entire experience involve no meaningful decision making and having it be extremely tedious and boring. There are large balance issues with certain cards being much too efficient and easy to consistently draw due to deck size. Pass.";2.9;0.0;1.0;85.0;Posted: June 29, 2021

I like the look, the theme and general direction this game is taking. Pixel art spaceships and roguelike.....take my credits! But For the Warp (FtW) makes you appreciate FTL, Slay the spire (StS) and many other roguelikes;

I am not enjoying the gameplay right now. It feels very RNG heavy and I'm constantly getting my butt kicked. The first ship is not very good with it's measly shield cap of 10hp and you will routinely run into groups of 3 enemies who hit for 9dmg each a round. Bosses hit for 10-20, and mid sized enemies can also do 10-20 damage. It's very hard to keep your shields up while also putting up an offense. The second ship is immediately better boasting 15shield cap and a ton of attack and draw cards. The game drastically gets more fun in the second ship, but the world is still wonky and not set up in an approachable way. I hope the other ships are cooler still but I don't feel inspired to play more and unlock them.

The grid you fly around on is frustrating. I find I""m getting bombarded with enemies, then bombarded with allied ships but there isn't any way for me to know ahead of time what I will run into. In FTL you could see the whole region and make a guess at which routes to avoid and which ones would be better. In FtW you only know one space ahead and backtracking costs precious fuel. You will run out resources.

In SlayTheSpire you could also plan ahead how many bosses/rests/merchants you'd roughly encounter. In FtW you can't plan at all. I""m often sitting outside the boss gate with 10%hp and not enough fuel to explore for help. Was I supposed to power through in a straight line? How many encounters should I risk for loot? It's incomprehensible.

I miss that in FTL the stations all offered the same services. You could always buy fuel, repair and purchase from a wide variety of weapons, drones and ship upgrades. SlayTheSpire had a similarly good merchant who offered card removal and card upgrades along with his RNG items. FtW could really benefit from stable merchants. The cost of fuel and repair is wildly different and making that last fuel jump to a station that doesn't sell fuel is very frustrating. I could see space games drop fuel as a mechanic if I""m honest.

The merchants in FtW would be better if they had actual selection. Three cards and one equipment is silly small. There are many deck styles you could build in this game. Either make the cards cheaper so that you can buy a large number and design your play deck and side deck, or give the players way more selection. In one instance I had a significant amount of money, and I bought more equipment than I could use, but there is nothing you can do with it afterwards. No merchant buys equipment from you and it's not relevant to any story based encounters. So if you don't plan on using the cards, you can't reliably get rid of them and they don't serve a story purpose....can I send the out the airlock?

Ultimately I want this game to be good but I don't like it right now. I am leaving a down vote so that the Devs see this feedback, but I also hope that other players will play the game in hopes that the devs get the resources they need to continue. I won't be refunding and will keep my fingers crossed that some of my concerns are addressed, or that other improvements are made.";2.1;0.0;19.0;220.0;Posted: 29 March

Terrible game, dont buy it.
It seems like a mix of Slay the Spire and FTL, but with only the worst parts of both games.
- Tedious and boring fights, you are limited to about 2 types of encounters per region which repeats for about 5 to 10 times per region. On top of that, All enemies are essentially the same with different stats, as they largely have the same attack moves.
- Pointsless events, the best part of FTl and Slay the Spire was to step on those question mark tiles and not knowing what to expect. In this game 9 out of 10 times is you get some fuel/ cash or sell/scrap a card for cash.
- Ships that you unlock are the same just with different starting stats and starting deck. Making progression meaning less.
- The equipments that you can find are about as basic as it gets.";7.4;0.0;5.0;93.0;Posted: March 30

I don't quite want to give this game a bad review but it desperately needs some balancing, more events, and more varied fights. Seems like a very early release for something that still seems like a beta

Missing UI and information
- Does a drone get hit when you take damage? Is it random? How does drone HP work?
- What's my max HP? If you have cards that act on a ship having 50% HP, I need some indicator of what max health is
- This card generates X card. What is that card?
- Directional moving can be a little hard to parse sometimes

Sometimes the game just...doesn't seem to process correctly. I use all my energy...and still need to click end turn. I purchase a service from an NPC ship...and the screen doesn't progress. I exit to menu and there's no option to continue my in progress game...but I close the game and reopen it and now it shows.

This game has great art and music. It has some great idea. Execution though...this game is still early access. I've had fairly regular bugs. Needs balancing, like there are OP cards that discard your hand but cost all your energy so there's no real downside.

I'd like to come back to this game in a few months but I can't recommend it as is. Hope the dev can make some improvements.";3.6;0.0;2.0;431.0;Posted: March 31

Sorry but here isn't middle score just good or bad.
I will change this negative flag if the developer fixing some issue.

Good/OK:
The main concept.
Pixel art.

Less Good:
- Sound average (as comrade Dyatlov would say: ""not good not bad"")
- Music very repetitive but not a big concern (some mp3 in the background can fix it)
- Events variation too few and very ""dry"" - some real surprise or humor it would be shake up the game
- Few ship (3) :yes - I think the dev plan more
- Few combination for upgrade - I know more balance issue

Bad (why am I wrote the review):
- Third Ship the KD Carrier. This ship starter card kit is a joke.
I played through 3 system (kill all enemies on every map) with the second ship (Light Destroyer) and lose with the bad karma - constant bad card and all the Enemy ships hit with max damage...
But the Carrier has only low shield and weak Drone cards at the beginning (most spawn - yes I can select some others at the beginning but they are rare in the first couple of battle) and if I meet the first triad Ship group they instant eat up my Hull - maybe not kill just make it difficult to continue .

The game is ok, but the total randomness of the cards really detracts. Starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships. If you encounter multiple 3 ship groups in a row you just plain lose. The damage output balance is very weak. It feels like a beta game.

Like other reviews have said, the draw mechanic is nonsensical. You don't draw a card from the top, you draw it from a pool. So you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them.

Finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire. Got nothing for it, Hardcore didn't even unlock. Game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others. Art is pretty nice, the theme is good. Ran into several bugs.

Ultimately disappointing. Listen to other popular negative comments. They're right.

This game struggles from extreme balancing issues. I wouldn't even bother picking this up until they're fixed, if they ever are. The drone carrier, which seems like a super fun ship, can't even get passed the first few battles in Hardcore because you can't keep your drones alive. Basic issues like that stop this game from going up in the ranks of STS type games. Art is super awesome at least.

I also experienced an invincibility bug that made every enemy permanently miss me. Got to see the whole game for free and unlocked everything.

2 things before we begin
1st even though this is a negative review i still enjoy the game, and will probably change this review after a few patches
2nd This is the edited version.

This game is far to RNG heavy, and i think it could be fixed with 1 of 2 things.
Either give us the power to build a deck, by removing or adding cards to your deck, even if it is just at the start of the sector.
Or give us a bigger choice of cards at the start of each Sector.
My reason for this is simple, they is no way of forming a complete build besides random luck.

All that said I did have fun playing and will keep playing but I suggest you wait for a few patches to come out before you buy the game.";11.3;0.0;2.0;306.0;Posted: March 30, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For The Warp has a lot of charm.
The bit-style art is nice, the music is fun and appropriate.
But the game is severely lacking in the balance department.
This lack of balance really makes you relinquish any feeling of real freedom that your choices matter; as you can make every ""perfect"" play and you'll still lose pretty quickly.
The difficulty stacked up against you cannot be overstated, and the constant over-powered opponents are a wall too high to climb with skill, as you'll often feel like the encounters you win are due to pure luck.

Attacks have no ""chance"" to hit either-- just a range of damage it WILL do.
You can never actively evade or dodge. You can never attempt to escape an opponent who is too overwhelming for you.
So you're stuck just watching your whole run get blown away due to a random (and seemingly likely chance) you'll see an opponent who just mops the floor with you.

To add to the difficulty, you start the game with 100 coins and can buy from a selection of 3-4 random cards.
That's it.
You are stuck using your incredibly under-powered deck of actions against opponents which can out-damage you, out-shield you, and have the benefit of numbers on you almost every combat.

You most certainly will run out of fuel EVERY game, as the only way to stay alive, being so severely outgunned all the time, is to try and avoid conflict (and you can't).
You don't make enough money to do anything important, nor will you run across a way to fix your ship's shields.
Running out of fuel will invite even more overpowered encounters to spawn directly on you-- to where you will eventually throw your hands up and put the game back on the shelf.

I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's too unbalanced and you won't want to play very long when you feel like the game constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ you without any determinable merit to the challenge.";0.9;0.0;4.0;353.0;Posted: March 21, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have pointed out, this game has a lot of great features and has some compelling gameplay. However, there are three things that kill it for me because they lead too far down the path of heavy RNG.

1) The shuffler makes no sense. The fact that you don't discard cards and that every time you draw a hand that you are pulling from your entire deck is against the foundation of what a deck builder game is supposed to be. It has all of the other facets of how to build and manipulate your deck but the player should be drawing from a shuffled stack and continue to do such until the discard pile needs to be shuffled back in. I might have been less opposed to this if you could freely discard cards from your deck without needing to pay for it or have NPC's want to buy them during events. But as it stands, it is far to easy to get a 18-20 card deck and that is far too much RNG when doing pool draws.

2) Draft mode is not worth playing due to the design of ships and certain cards. Each ship has a core deck archetype that goes with them. To top it off, you are shown 10 cards to pick from, then 9, then 8, etc. While this would certainly be what you would experience playing Magic: the Gathering, the cards do not have enough synergy to interface with each other in this format let alone to build a half way viable starter deck that matches the ship you selected. Also, you select the ship BEFORE you draft which should be the other way around. See what comes to you and what archetype you can build towards then decide what ship you want. The problem stated in #1 compounds this since you might not have that many shield cards and drawing them when you are getting blasted for 40 damage a round in the first map is not a good experience.

3) While playing in normal mode, there are certain cards you need to make your ship's archetype deck come together and there is no way to guarantee that you get those. As such, it leads to runs that are destined to fail because you, through RNG, just don't power up your deck to the point that you can handle later encounters. Especially when you get screwed by not drawing what you need from your pool (see #1) for several turns.


I like the premise of the game and it has a great foundation. Hopefully, these issues will get addressed by the developer in the near future as I look forward to playing this game after those patches land.";12.2;0.0;16.0;235.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

It has the feel of FTL, but plays similar to slay the spire. The biggest turnoff for me, and what ended up causing me to refund it, is that you don't draw from your deck. Every turn, you get 5 random cards out of the cards in your deck. you could get the same hand over and over; it does not cycle through all the cards. For example, In my 21 card deck, I had one copy of a card that boosts the attack of all your active drones and 3 cards that made drones. In one battle (and the battles are decently lengthy) I drew the drone boost card every turn, but never once did I draw a card that made a drone. It was very frustrating. In addition, energy is not saved between turns but shields are (there is a shield capacity), so you can have totally wasted turns where you draw mostly shields and your shields are already at max so the turn just gets wasted.

In short, I enjoyed FTL and slay the spire but found this to be more frustrating than fun.";0.5;0.0;78.0;1004.0;Posted: 8 April, 2020

I can't in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could. As other reviews have said, this game has potential. I truly believe this game as good potential, the stuff to become a great game. But, it has an issue. A major glaring issue.

It has no replayability. For a game priced at $21.5 AUD, I would expect there to be some replayability in this game. Now granted, it has done something to that end. There are 5 ships in the game. The problem with those ships however is that they only affect starting cards and stats. Nothing about the run itself changes. Card rewards are the same. Encounters are basically dealt with in the same manner. No special equipment for individual ships. Nothing. Once you start a game, it's all the same.

I can't see myself playing this game again. I am bored. I am bored of this game. I know how I should play now, I know what makes for a good deck of cards and what isn't. I know what all of the encounters are like now. Although on that topic, what's the point in different encounters? The different encounters barely affect by I play. Some encounters will be more health draining then others based on some RNG factors, while others I just pass through not even so much as a scratch. Difficulty isn't what makes encounters different, but the encounters are so similar and samey, that's how I see them. My play-style doesn't change, just how much health I am going to lose.

With the ships not changing how the game itself is run, and the encounters all blurring together. The first couple of runs will be fun, but after that. It's all the same. I can not recommend this game if you value replayability.";5.8;0.0;1.0;112.0;Posted: November 25, 2021

This still feels like it's in early access, and could use some work before it's set. At the moment, the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions. Most of the cards you get also just don't see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - they're just small numbers boosts a lot of the time.

Both because of animation speeds, enemy health/shield pools, and the limited damage output of even your most synergy-dependant, powerful attacks, battles take a very long time by ""roguelite deckbuilder"" standards (though perhaps you may be used to the pace if you've played a lot of Deck of Ashes). But a big issue is that each map - of the 5 you go through for one 'run' of the game - is filled to the brim with enemy encounters and there's very rarely anything stopping you from going through all of them, plus the myriad of beneficial random encounters and 'quest'-like events dragging you back and forth over the map very, very slowly.

I suspect the ""Fuel"" mechanic - as well as your health limits - is intended to prevent you from just fighting constantly for huge quantities of money and other partial benefits, but it fails to function because there are cards that let you easily earn Fuel in-battle, as well as heal in-battle, as well as even permanently remove selected cards from your deck in-battle. As a result, you can easily just leave 1 enemy alive in a battle then spend all of the time you need healing to full, optimizing your deck and restocking your fuel (until the enemy eventually runs away).

In its current state, a very poor handling of in-battle resources with out-of-battle, run-long resources leaves a glacially paced, unfulfilling and fundamentally boring game, lacking inventive classes, deckbuilding, story or much of anything else. I do give some credence to the aesthetic and theming of the game, but even that runs dry quickly when there appears to be as little as 3 (4?) visually distinct enemies per map, and (not counting bosses) seemingly only about 18 or so types of enemies in the game.

And those 18 enemy types are painfully similar. In fact, same with bosses. Enemies just... attack you for X-Y damage, shield themselves (basically self-heal) for X-Y damage, and... that's actually almost it. Occasionally they will take an offensive action like decrease your max shield or place an absolutely trivial damage-over-time effect to you (like ""1 damage over 3 turns"" at a time when enemies are regularly doing 10-14 damage with regular attacks). Occasionally an enemy may spawn a new enemy which... just does the same thing. Deal X-Y damage, shield themselves for X-Y, or do some minor amount of DoT or max shield decrease.

On top of all of the many issues, even if they fixed the ability to exploit battles to maximize all of your resource gains too easily, your cards are both super slow and yet they easily let you break the game. In my first battle, I was just playing a ""barrel roll"" card every turn rendering me literally immune to damage on each turn, and there seemed to be no penalty or limitation to doing so.

Bad balance, minimal content, minimal variety, minimum difficulty, terrible pacing. This is, sadly, probably the worst deckbuilding roguelike game I've played on Steam.";2.9;0.0;4.0;380.0;Posted: August 15, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this. I like the premise, having some elements of FTL but it's extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one, drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile. If they changed this I could see the game being a lot better, but it's restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity. In my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies. It's a refund for now, but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care.";0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;Posted: April 25, 2021

Read, i explain it all.

=> The game DON'T AUTOSAVE ! (or it's totaly bugged)

I was doing a run, was at the end, was going to lose next turn on a boss because RNG hate you, you know'

So i Alt-F4, expecting a save at the start of the battle or just before, how foolish i was. First of all, all my run progress got erased, like i never did it (so bye bye the unlock of ships, still got the success thought, but useless) and worst of all, when i clicked continue, it loaded a save of my previous run !

Another thing very infuriating is the first round of battles, you ONLY draw 3 cards (knowing your hand is limited to five), so basicaly, you got enemies who are mostly going to hit you first round, and a good amount of time, you are just defenseless because jesus, you only have 3 CARDS, did you realize how much it's horrible more you advance in the chapters ? Taking free damages for this reason only is stupid, just let us got a basical 5 cards starting hand for god sake.

Also, ION attacks aren't considered attacks for counter maneuvering, nor even ofensives non-direct attacks actions.

Other problem, there isn't enough explanations on your cards (when your mouse is on it), you mostly are like ""wtf this is doing"" and there is no glossary to explain in game.

Another obscure thing who is, there is no discarded deck, so all discarded cards return to your deck, this mean you can draw a tons of cards before having the ones you need because of RNG, this isn't logic. Plus, there is so little numbers of stations or other who can scrap cards, worst of it is the stations who does it, does it only one time, and the best (very rare) stations who do it repeatidly do it for a huge cost.

Talking about stations, there is a true problem for the fuel, you can't really take the time to explore, but you can't really go in one line because not every station sell fuel, it's mostly rare or costly.

Right now, don't take too much cards in your deck even if you can have a ton, because of the 3 cards starting hand and the fact there is (it seems) no discard deck, and scraping cards is too rare or too costly. The problem ? It seems you can endlessly got the sames cards before pulling the ones you desperately need.

And i just played in normal.

This is a tentative thumbs down. Beat the game on my second or third run when I realized you sometimes just get an amazing equipment (like permanent +1 energy) right at the start of the game and it's essentially a free win. Lots of unbalanced cards and strange design decisions, doesn't quite have the replay factor or the alternatives (Slay the Spire, Monster Train, heck even FTL). Fun quick little game with quite a few cards which surprised me but no balance or ""satisfaction"" for a lot of events. Very repetitive. I love the art style but the execution is bland.

Misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun. Poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable. There are also a lot of poor design decisions, like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible: Stack as much shield as possible every turn, then spend remaining energy on attack cards, with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing.";7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;Posted: April 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't think I can recommend For the Warp in its current state (January 2021). After three hours, I already beat the game once after 4-5 tries and I don't have that urge to try and beat the game with the other ships like I do in other roguelites.

Encounters are fairly repetitive with low variance and there doesn't seem to be much variety in enemy types. All enemies seem to do mostly the same thing just with varying HP pools. It's not even close to Slay the Spire where different encounters require you to approach the enemies differently.

Card balance seems a little off. A number of cards seem to require you to get other cards to make them useful, but there's no guarantee you're ever even going to see cards of those types. On the other hand, I have been able to make some broken combos using cards that aren't crap on their own.

There's also poor explanation of mechanics. For example, one card I've seen has the Explosive property. It sounds like it's supposed to ignore X% of armor, but it just says 0% on there. Is there something I'm missing? I also still don't understand how the Synergy keyword works with its vague description. Another card tells me it does more damage for each ""Plasma"" type in my hand, but I don't know how to tell if a card is Plasma type or not. I thought maybe it was if the card had ""Plasma"" in the name, but my starter cards with Plasma in the name didn't seem to count.

On a positive note, the game looks and sounds pretty good, although I do wish cards had more on-screen effects. The game also has a twist on deck building where there is no discard, which I find interesting. Cards you play in a turn immediately get sent back and shuffled into the deck. This causes you to approach deck building a little different than the typical deck building approach where you don't reshuffle until you've played your entire deck.

Right now, I think they need to work on card balance and make encounters actually interesting. With every encounter playing out the same, the game gets boring extremely fast.";2.9;0.0;8.0;2352.0;Posted: January 21, 2021

Can't immediately quit and restart a new run easily. Instead forced to sit through laggy menus and scenes everytime. I'm going to re-roll those initial selections A LOT, so I'd rather not waste my time. Everything else is slow too, with no speed-up option. Why does everything take so long? Why can't I click past events?

You only get 3 (maybe 5) trinkets max, so there's no going crazy with those. Most cards seem weak, except for some really busted ones. Deck is reshuffled every turn with no discard pile(??). Better to cull your deck than build one and wait for one of the busted cards. Prices at the shops seem all over the place. Value in general seems could use some reconsidering.

Also buggy with events just not working sometimes, forcing restarts.

I've played a lot of FTL and Slay the Spire as well as many other deckbuilding/exploration/roguelikes. They are my favorite games, and so I was sad that this one missed the mark for me. It looked right up my alley, but the problem was that there was just too much RNG in the way without a lot of time to counter it. I couldn't find the mechanic to scrap cards fast enough so my deck became bloated fast, and I kept running into unavoidable unwinnable fights. I investigated one space and fought some mega-ship that did 30-50 damage a shot. I had the card to escape a combat but I was dead before I drew it.

And why is my starting hand only 3 cards? When there are three ships each swinging for 9 damage on the first round and I draw 3 base attacks it's not much help. Also, 3-9 is not an acceptable range of damage for me to plan around, nor is 10-18. That's too much control for the RNG to have and I'm not interested in continuing to play until the RNG gods deem it appropriate for me to win.

I do like that your shields carry over if you don't use them, but that just means I over-shield every time and only attack when I'm above the max shield. shrink the ranges, or maybe do away with them altogether, but at least shrink them.

I'm more than willing to keep trying and to figure it out, but then there is the issue that the core mechanics were not very fun. I don't see why I need to select my ship in order to shield if I'm the only ship that's there that logically I would want to shield. Explain to me why I have to select a ship to attack if there is only one target. It would be more fun if there was a right-click default action for cards that are obvious on how a general player would use them.

Also, the cutscenes and dialog aren't fast enough for me. Put the text up there, allow me to hit enter to skip it. Every single time you approach something t h e g a m e h a s t o m a k e y o u w a i t t o r e a d t h e d e s c r i p t i o n and it bores me every time. I read fast and I don't play games to be bored. Maybe there's a setting to control this in the options, fine, but whatever the fastest setting in should be the default and there should be a setting to slow it down if you like long-drawn out time to read text because I'm going to go ahead and assume that's the minority.

It's very possible this game could hook people but for me there are too many games out there without these issues, so I can't recommend trying this out.

Make it faster, snappier, and with less instant death.";0.8;0.0;8.0;303.0;Posted: April 1

It's an intriguing entry in the card-battle genre, but I was disappointed to beat it on the first try! I had a card that gave shields and HP for just 1 energy, and doesn't get removed from your deck, so I was basically invulnerable.

In general, it doesn't feel like much effort has been spent on card balance. I'd recommend getting Slay the Spire, Monster Train, or Griftlands instead.";2.8;0.0;2.0;349.0;Posted: May 12, 2021

And in my journey of the lands between I found that it is worth playing and worth having, for despite it's flaws such as some bad hitboxes, and the meta users in pvp who cannot do anything fun and challenging build-wise but find the quickest and broken way to kill you. Elden Ring is truely an adventure to embark unto. Finally, the best part that kept me playing the game, was the fact that I could change my build and make my gameplay experience more of a challenge by customizing role-play builds that would make my fights with the bosses and mobs more entertaining and more stylish than just using the rivers of blood katana to one shot everything, while wearing the clunkiest looking knight armour.

I've been a fan of the franchise since Dark Souls 1 on xbox. Elden Ring is without a doubt the best, most fleshed out, and most evolved version of the Soulsbourne formula.

Without going into to much detail, this game evolves on almost everything from the former games.
Blocking is more viable and there is a guard-counter attack system.
For standard weapons, you can change the weapon skill for free at rest sites which allows much more flexibility and experimentation.

Probably the most impressive thing about Elden Ring is that, despite the massive world and great amount of content, there are basically no drops in quality throughout. Nothing really feels rushed or half-finished, there are no areas which feel lazy or poorly designed.
A couple of optional bosses re-use enemies, similar to the Stray Demons in DS1.

While a lot of the changes made in this game add more depth to the combat system, a lot has been done to support new players to the franchise and there are more tutorials and information provided to the player. Additionally, I think this is probably the best Soulsbourne game for a full co-op playthrough, due to the improvements to multiplayer.

If you've never played a Soulsbourne game before, this is the perfect game to start with.

I don't know, just put Dark Souls 3 in an open world with some extra stuff and call it a day.

Elden Ring is a game where I am not exactly sure where I should put it when it comes to a rating of 1-10.
Regardless of what I think about it, I still enjoyed it and had a great time playing through it for the first time, but alas, my desire to replay it is non-existent. Once I got my final achievement to 100% it, I dropped it.
It has its upsides, and it's downsides, just like any other game ever made, and in this review, I will attempt to share my views and thoughts on it.


The Good

-There's a big world out there to explore, and as it's open-world, you have the freedom to explore on your own pace and go wherever you want. You can make it hard for yourself by rushing to the first boss you see and trying to fight it while likely under-leveled and under-geared, or you can stop to explore the world and come back to the boss once you've gotten some gear upgrades and level ups.
This allows each playthrough to be just a little big different depending on the paths you choose.

-Exploration is rewarded. There is a lot of different kinds of dungeons scattered around the world. They remind me a lot of dungeoneering from Runescape. You enter a dungeon, fight some monsters, solve some puzzles, fight a boss at the end and get loot. It's always interesting to find one and wonder what kind of loot you'll find.
There's also these smaller little dungeons that hold a chest inside but with no enemies, but these require you to have a key item which you can find while you explore the world or purchase from merchants.
It's pretty simple stuff, but it is a welcome addition regardless.

-Lots of weapon variety, allowing for lots of build variety. There's your basic weaponry which are still powerful and can be infused with the ashes of war to provide different weapon arts, and then there's your unique weaponry, powerful and equipped with their own unique weapon art.
It's really nothing new, other than for the ashes for war which I found to be a decent addition, but it is a plus regardless.

-Some interesting new mechanics. For example, the spirit summons are a cool, although somewhat controversial addition. Torrent, your steed, is there to make traversing the world less slow and painful, and there's even a crafting system that allows you to put some resources you gather to use.
You have new spells like the madness inflicting ones, and new ailments like the blackflame which saps away your opponents health for a short period of time.

-Cool bosses.
The satisfaction of beating a boss is still there, so if that's all you need from this game, go ahead and buy it.



-The world feels empty in some areas. For example, the lake by the academy is so barren that it's just a W key simulator. There's a reason you get fast traveling right from the get-go, otherwise it would be torturous.
Not to mention that often you wont even be able to fast travel since some random enemy you didn't even know existed within a kilometer radius somehow is in combat with you.

-Mostly pointless crafting system. In my over 100 hours put in the game, I never used the crafting system more than once, and I was only testing it out. It feels like an after thought to me, giving the player the ability to craft some basic consumable equipment out of scrap they'll find littering the game-world.

-Too many re-used bosses.
I read somewhere that there's about 120 bosses in the game. Now ask yourself and don't lie: How many of those do you think are unique rather than repeated bosses, different bosses mashed up together, gank bosses, or normal enemies made into bosses?
Not to mention the fact that the unique bosses seem to be designed around you using spirit summons, and purposefully delay their attacks so that learning their move-sets and timing is mandatory.

-Armor is still useless. It's just like Dark Souls 3, armor is there only for the looks, and barely makes a difference at all. Poise is still a broken mess, and the defenses and resistances just don't matter.
Your better off going naked into battle so you wont be getting heavy load.

-The traditional Dark Souls quest-design does not work well for this game.
In Dark Souls, you would likely come across the npc's naturally as you progressed since it was a more linear game, but since Elden Ring is an open-world game, the chances of you coming across that npc that you just talked to in the game world are very slim. Using Google is almost mandatory for this game if you want to do all the optional questlines.



I never played PvP so that's why I didn't mention it in my review.
I'd still recommend the game if you're an old fan of From, but if you're only just looking to get into the souls-franchise, I wouldn't recommend starting with this.
Dark Souls and Bloodborne are still my favorites in the From Software catalog.";109.3;1.0;0.0;107.0;Posted: May 22

SCREAMING, urinating on the ceiling even and then falling to the ground and sobbing whilst depressively rolling around in said urine. this has destroyed nearly all meaningful relationships to the outside world and caused my testicles to cumbust. despite this it was absolutely nut blasting, perhaps one might argue it is busting... sheesh... maybe even respectfully. i have come to this conclusion after i had gotten stuck in the ground during a boss fight that this is infact goated. one might argue that there is not just one goat attached to this game however but several, you just cannot see them because it is actually an expirement by the CIA to make invisible goats to make goat noises while you are pushing your fecal matter down the drain whilst showering. one final question to ask however for any readers of this review, is it really waffle stomping if the drain is a circular shape and is also the drain of the bath tub? please debate amongst yourselfs and remeber to back it up with fact based evidence.";43.2;1.0;1.0;117.0;Posted: May 23

To me, this is my favorite game ever made. It has a perfected form of the combat from previous fromsoft games, it has a stunning amount of beautiful and varied content. GRRM's worldbuilding stretches the normal worldbuilding of something like dark souls into more dimensions, factions that only appeared on the surface before in the form of covenants. My best friend and I often joke that ER is ""Dark Souls squared"" in content, and to me it is in overall quality as well. I can't recommend this game enough. It was bought for me as a birthday gift, and I dare say it is the best gift I ever received.";300.5;1.0;0.0;72.0;Posted: May 23

I love this game. It is the kind of game that I have been craving for years. I have played many of FromSoft's games in the past and I am very well aware of the performance issues that comes with their PC ports. Day one, when I got it, my frames were ass. One simple change of changing it from fullscreen to borderless windowed and I was set. I had very few issues after that (invisible enemies only happening when I had been playing for far too long) and the ride I had with this game was beautiful. This is the first Souls game that I have played on day one and going in with no idea where anything was or what to expect was magical. Even with my hundreds of hours into the game that I already have I am still discovering new things and interactions and that just tells me that there was a LOT of care put into the details of this game. Overall I will highly recommend this game to veteran and new players alike.";373.7;1.0;0.0;166.0;Posted: May 20

There are probably two types of people who might be interested in Elden Ring: there are the souls-series fans that have already played and probably beaten Elden Ring by now, and there are the people on the fence about it and are worried it'll be too ""hard-core"" for them. I'm going to try and make a review for both types of people here.

First, for those new to the series. Elden Ring and basically every other souls-series game are really just action rpg's that have an emphasis on discovery. What I mean by this is that this game will rarely straight up tell you anything. The story is extremely detached from your character feeling more like you're just someone in the world rather than the ""main character."" The fun in the story is in just figuring out what it really is (or watching youtube videos that do it for you). Not just the story though, the game hints at your objective, but won't lay it out in simple blunt terms like most games. You won't get a way-marker on where all of the main bosses are, instead you have golden lines from the checkpoints that point in the direction of the nearest one. You're meant to figure out all of the fine details of everything with the game. You aren't told that many upgrade materials are found in mines, you eventually figure it out through some common sense and/or pattern recognition whenever you enter a mine. You aren't told you're under powered for a certain boss, you just figure it out when you can barely do damage to it and it one-shots you. You aren't told that 90% of your damage is really based on how upgraded your weapon is rather than your level, you're shown it. I could go on, but I think you get the picture. What these games offer is a sense of wonderment and discovery, not too different from older NES/SNES games but with more modern game design sensibilities.

For those who get the souls-series and want to know what Elden Ring offers that the others didn't. That is mainly a much more open world with surprises behind every corner, and a much more diverse and powerful magic system with the game designed around you using the FP bar on something rather than having certain builds easily avoid it. Unfortunately, the game suffers from a few technical issues most notably with multiplayer co-op. Often times, if you're trying to play with a friend, you can only reliably be in their game and vice-versa for a few minutes before the game kicks you back to your world sometimes. Other times, it works great. It's very inconsistent.

Beyond that, the game itself has a few balance issues, and repeated content most notably in bosses. The balance of the game takes a hard spike around the second half requiring you to have at least 50-60 vigor to not be one shot by most enemies, and the amount of runes you get for defeating certain ones is all over the place, with some insanely hard ones dropping pitiful amounts and easy ones dropping an insane amount. It's never impossible, but it starts to require you to do cheap tactics to handle certain encounters reliably like exploiting the AI, slowly killing them with ranged attacks when they can't reach you, or using one of the many imbalanced weapons that do WAY more damage than the rest. Next, the bosses, many people hear Elden Ring has 83 bosses and thinks ""wow, that's a lot"" when really so many of them are copy/pasted with VERY minor alterations that in reality it only has about 20 if I'm being generous. Now, it wouldn't be as much a problem if it was relegated to just the end of side dungeons, but many of these repeats happen in the main game levels too. The weird tree thing is used so often in the game that it might as well be a mini-boss. For regular enemies too, you start to notice the repeat just with higher damage and health. Where in other souls games, you'd start to feel burn out on repeated content after replaying it 3-4 times, Elden Ring already gave me that feeling before I beat it the first time. Makes it much more of a drag to replay for a different build that you end up just running past most enemies because you can't be bothered to kill the same thing for the 1000 time.

But beyond that, it's one of the best games I've ever played and I do recommend it despite the amount of criticisms I threw at it just before. Though I still think I like Bloodborne more.";218.2;1.0;0.0;307.0;Posted: May 16

Worth the 60 dollars because its been a long time since someone came out with a finished product and no graphics gimmicks or loot boxes before they fix bugs and glitches. I only played Sekiro from their game studio but i do plan to go back and play their others, with that being said i felt this game was only kind of difficult. Sekiro seemed way harder because everyone would wreck me. In Elden Ring after i got the hang of the first two bosses i only had a hard time with stupid crucible knights and the frogs. The game is beautiful and the hard work shows, weapons and sorcery choices are immense, and so much content Being such a big game was a blessing and a curse, sometimes i missed things and had no idea or a npc would say the same thing for a very long time making me think they was stuck even progressing passed parts or sometimes npc would just disappear and i don't know where they went. Another negative is the camera. It is hard to see sometimes and camera will make the player do weird things when near the wall. Overall this is one of the best games i played in a long time especially when the stuttering slowly went away after playing for a while.";127.0;1.0;2.0;183.0;Posted: May 21

The Good:
This is FromSofts best game to date.

The combat is buttery and smooth with wide variety of weapons, spells and trinkets that create a wonderful web for potentially very diverse builds. It is intense and spectacular with a niche for every player and playstyle. Magic is more interesting than ever before without feeling overpowered as the game offers a huge selection of various spells and incantations with varying effects.

The game itself looks absolutely stunning and is packed with content and secrets at every corner and the locations all hide a huge amount of very intriguing lore as well as unique encounters and locations. Exploration is extremely rewarding and fun as the world while punishing is very fun to navigate and particularly in the early and midway stages of the game I found myself captivated and drawn to explore every inch of the areas laid out in front of me.

The games lore and storyline is compelling and extremely well written as well as implemented perfectly and generally seamlessly into the world.

The Meh:
Bosses are a mixed bag in this game and their quality is vastly inconsistent compared to other FromSoft games. While some are in my opinion some of the best ever made such as Dragonlord Placidusax, Morgott The Omen King and Mogh Lord of Blood, many severely suffer from being simply too big to fit on the camera thus making their moves unpredictable and frustrating to deal with, turning combat into a wild scramble to deal damage and roll away which is made worse by the trend of delayed attacks and rollcatching moves in this game.

Furthermore some bosses (looking at you Godskins) are copy and pasted throughout the game and while some may see it as a tasteful recurring enemy with a variety of combinations, others may feel them to be lazy and unimaginative.

NPCs are interesting and their questlines are rewarding and fun but due to the non linear and spacious nature of the game it could use better indicators as to where to go, although I will say the developers have been very attentive to the complaints of the players regarding that and have marked the locations of NPCs.

The Bad:

It saddens me to say that the PVP is quite simply horrendous which is a shame especially in a game with such potential variety for interesting and unique builds, there are perhaps 2 or 3 builds that can found in the online world, and all of them using weapons that are essentially similar in nature. Katanas and bleed reign supreme and whilst I do not judge any method of playing in single player, the clear advantage that certain builds and weapons posses make for a very unfun PVP experience comparatively to other games such as DS3.";379.3;1.0;0.0;52.0;Posted: May 17

Tl;dr - I'm a big fan of From Software and have played DS1, DS2, DS3 and Bloodborne. Let's look past the marketing fluff and the unrealistic 10/10 ratings this game has received before launch. Please remember, this is purely my view and shouldn't in any way influence your decisions. Elden Ring is an awesome game and an amazing experience, albeit it a bit overambitious and just way too long (I’m a completionist). Truly a landmark achievement for From Software. 8/10 would recommend at least one play-through. A masterpiece? It depends...

The Good:

If you're familiar with previous titles you'll feel right at home. It's textbook From Software and incorporates mechanics from all previous titles. The biggest notable change is in the combat mechanics. Those who dabble in PvP mostly benefit from this change as the build variety is enormous.

Graphics are beautiful and the world building is astonishing allowing for a fully immersed experience. You will find yourself pausing often to view many of the world's amazing vistas.

Combat feels smooth and intuitive. Despite a ton of new spells & abilities, the character animations are smooth and combat feels very satisfying.

The music is epic. It feels very different to previous titles. Not as dark as Dark Souls, however, there were countless moments where the hairs on my neck were standing up. There's nothing better than fighting epic bosses complimented by an epic score.

NPC character design is fresh but still in line with what the company is known for. Expect all manner of strange and normal NPC's. This is high fantasy at its best.

Day & Night cycles are a great addition to the From Software formula and really brings the world’s atmosphere to life.

As a primarily solo player, I was happy to find that I am no longer invaded all the time. Invasions now seem to only happen during cooperative play. Which I'll also cover in ""The Bad"" section of the review.

The boss design is great, bar a few...

The Bad:

The game feels overambitious. The fact that it’s From Software’s first attempt at a massive open world, really shows. You can clearly see that most of the effort went into the first couple of zones as the quality drops when you start noticing the reuse of assets in later zones. Which brings me to my next point.

Elden Ring's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness. I.e., the massive open world. Because of the sheer size, the game fails to create the intimate and memorable experiences the previous titles created. This is largely due to the fact that the large landmass merely serves as a glue between the more traditional legacy dungeons and unfortunately there's not much between The Lands Between. It feels like butter scraped over too much bread. In typical From Software fashion (much more than in any previous title due to the size), many of the game's assets are repeated, copied, and pasted throughout the world. There's the classic dungeon crawler mix of caves, catacombs, ruins, churches, sewers etc. However, with each iteration they feel less unique and intuitive and this contributed to me feeling burned out after a while. This is not a big living world. Most things are static and will only perform what they’re scripted to do. This was a massive missed opportunity as a world this size could’ve benefited greatly from dynamic events. E.g., you’re walking through a forest at night and suddenly you’re ambushed by bandits or an assassin jumps from a tree to slit your throat.

The story is as cryptic as ever. Another missed opportunity granted the fact that George R.R. Martin was involved. Not that it shows, though. In fact, I’m not quite sure what his contributions were other than for marketing purposes. Understand that I love George R.R. Martin’s work but From Software seems more than capable of creating lore-rich worlds as they’ve shown in all their previous titles and the mysterious approach to unraveling the plot is what they’re known for. However, I would’ve preferred with this release, a little more streamlined and traditional story-telling that’s easy to understand and to follow.

Invasions (Forced PvP), still happens during cooperative play but not solo play. This was a weird one for me to digest. For some people this is probably fine but for me and my partner, it's frustrating and retracts from the immersion and experience. All I wanted to do is explore The Lands Between with my partner while sipping on some cognac. At least allow players the opportunity to opt-out of PvP. The world is huge, allow us to explore it with our loved ones, uninterrupted.

Not optimized for PC and misleading recommended hardware. Everything was fine after I upgraded to an NVMe SSD, 32 gigs of ram, Geforce RTX 3070 Ti OC, and a clean install of Windows 11 Pro with the latest drivers. Keyboard and mouse controls... yeah don't waste your time. A controller is still highly recommended. No ultra-wide screen support and no ability to switch off chromatic aberration, a graphic technology that I’m not a fan of at all. Frames are also locked to 60 fps.

Some bosses are clearly designed for cooperative play which might turn away some solo players. And before you think “Git Gud”, I know all about spending weekends learning boss mechanics to topple a challenging foe as I’ve done it countless times in previous titles. Maybe I’m getting old. However, in this game some bosses are just insanely punishing to the point where I felt screw it, I’m going to summon some players to assist. And it felt good. There’s nothing wrong with summoning players for assistance. I’m looking at you, elitists. However, I would've preferred defeating them solo. I just couldn’t be bothered as some boss designs are not solo-friendly.

I also urge everyone who has enjoyed Elden Ring, to give the predecessors a go if you haven’t already done so. I myself will definitely be enjoying Dark Souls 1-3 again.";261.7;1.0;1.0;187.0;Posted: May 18

TL:DR Check at the bottom.

Firstly there NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS! NONE AT ALL. Once you pay up, that's it, play and wait for DLC Campaign. This is a trial and error type of game. Do your research on from Software Games before you buy.

However, this is the easiest of the Souls Series Games ( it felt a tad bit gentler than the other 12 previous years with from software, I didn't even need the vaseline this time....LOL) It is also the largest game they have made to date. 1st play through took me roughly 85 hours till credits ( If you work, have family and a life; that's about 1 to two months to reach credits) and I am yet to explore all the secrets. It's open world with heavy emphasis on Exploration. If you don't explore then it will become a challenge. The only issue as of now is still the balancing ( Stuttering has been fixed) . As I said, Explore and things become easy as you tend to level up fairly quickly (assuming you are holding on to/recovering those runes). Sometimes too easy because you might end up being too overpowered when it's time to tackle main story bosses. This only lasts up until late game phase.

In late game and endgame phase, everything ( Especially Bosses) becomes more overpowered than you and it will become a challenge if you don't utilize every arsenal From Soft gives you( that means if you don't co-op, you will typically become a master after facing a thousand deaths) . Bosses will two tap you sometimes and enemies take and DEAL a lot of damage in these stages. Broken builds and exploits have been slowly getting patched out, but they still exist. So far that has been the easy way to tackle things in the late game phase. Apart from co-op and broken builds, you have to rely on buffs and need to know how the buff system in Elden ring works if you want to reach the credits. There is no shame in looking up a guide ( I only recommend after you have been completely stumped so as to enjoy the Elden ring experience).

Pvp balancing is still broken. You will run into broken builds that demolish you in seconds. There isn't much I can say about it. You can choose to play the entire game offline, though it makes it harder to some extent as you will miss out on secret items that others have found.

In terms of how much content you get, it's a lot. The map is ridiculously huge, with multiple Biomes. The story is not as vague as previous From software titles if you read through the descriptions ( It's still vague though )but since this game is so large you will end up looking at lore videos online to connect everything together. I actually understood more after I finished the game. The trailers started make sense after i had experienced the game, this includes the intro Cinematic. There is too much to say about this game so I will end it here.

TL:DR
No micro transactions. Still a From Software title ( Trial and Error) but easier(Do your research on soul series if this is your first time). Huge amount of content to explore. Balancing issues need to be looked at. Good game ( and addictive). Worth your money. Waiting for First DLC campaign";128.5;1.0;0.0;78.0;Posted: May 18

Elden Ring is a commendable 7/10 game that you will most certainly get your money’s worth. However, it falls well short of a 10/10 and is absolutely not a masterpiece, there are too many flaws of significance for me to consider this one. For this spoiler-free review I will go through the main features that constitute an ER playthrough (and Souls games in general) and break down what ER did well regarding them, and what it did poorly.

1. MAP DESIGN AND EXPLORATION
Pros:
Huge map, one of the biggest games you will ever play
Well made “Legacy areas”, areas which are similar to the more linear sections of previous Souls games.
Exploration is rewarded, a lot to unlock and discover

Cons:
Open world gets “samey” quick, a lot of obvious reused assets and structures you explore over and over again. 4/5 of the open world areas are the same thing but different color palettes.

TLDR; Yes, I would definitely recommend this game.
I was shocked with how challenging this game was when I first started. I was happy to have the chance to pull in aid when frustrated on certain bosses and loved how it really made me explore ahead for certain items to help with my build and even make older content feel good again going back to complete certain pieces. I do wish that there was more warning that certain choices would lock you out of certain story lines, but I look forward to NG+ now because there were a few that I'd like to have done differently.";371.7;1.0;0.0;43.0;Posted: May 19

What a big, ambitious, crazy project of a game. I can't emphasize enough that Elden Ring and its world are absolutely HUGE, and its lore is equally gigantic and deep. Even with the combined efforts of a huge community, people are still piecing together mysteries in the plot and background lore.

I know Fromsoft games have a reputation of being brutal and punishing, and while Elden Ring is no walk in the park, I think the reputation is a bit overblown here. If something is too difficult, you can just leave and do something else, and come back to it later with new skills, new gear, more levels, etc. The summons system also gives a variety of NPC assists or even allows you to bring in other players to help. If that sort of thing dilutes the ever-important challenge, you can simply avoid those systems. But it's a helpful hand to people willing to leverage every tool to overcome some of the meaty challenges.

Elden Ring isn't perfect. It's deliberately obscure, some systems don't really pull their weight (like crafting and weapon upgrading), and lots of the math is more or less invisible to the player and left for the community to figure out. But it's good. My god it's good. And there's so damn much of it. At 281 hours, I've done two playthroughs and I'll probably come back for a third when there's DLC.";281.1;1.0;2.0;864.0;Posted: May 21

I know that Dark Souls 2 usually gets a bad rap, buts its actually really fun when you get the hang of it. There are some wonky animations that kinda hamper the experience but its not all bad, plus there's a yearly return to drangleic event that brings back a lot of people back to the game. All in all Dark souls Prepare to die edition is an amazing masterpeicec and i reccomend it to all who enjoy fantasy stories. When I first arrived in Boleteria (The place we are in when we arrive] I was plagued and died after beign able to do nothing, classic Dark souls.

One of the best games I have played in years.
I do not regret spending +200 hours playing this game, because it's simply fun to play.

It's undoubtedly not an easy game, but its difficulty doesn't come out of cheapness, but rather punishment for not adapting to the intuitive and superb mechanics of the game itself. It's the essence of 'Git Gud' mentality, learn and adapt to overcome the obstacles thrown at you, or continue to fail again and again. But what makes Elden Ring, like other 'Souls' games so fun to play is that you are rewarded tremendously for overcoming your obstacles - by the end of the game, you are strong enough to even conquer Gods and nothing feels as satisfying as coming into New Game Plus and squashing a Boss who troubled you for hours beforehand within mere seconds.

I admittedly have been a Souls fan since the Armored Core days so there is bias to my assessment - however I also understand why this game does not appeal to everyone for whatever reasons, and that's okay - I loved this game, and perhaps you will too.";232.4;1.0;0.0;226.0;Posted: May 17

Only 16 hrs in. But the first steps you take feel reminiscent of breath of the wild except you take 2 steps and get one shot by a boss that is standing right in front of you. Game is so much fun and you'll die 100+ times but you'll keep coming back for more";20.0;1.0;0.0;15.0;Posted: May 20

So I've never played a Dark souls game or rather anything from FromSoftware's developers before, but these are the things that I like and don't like--

Pros:
-Game looks amazing first of all, like everything visual about this game is awesome
-The combat can be fun imo depending on the enemy that you are fighting and build you are
-Open world is fantastic with places to discover or look at and hidden items are all over the place
-I personally like games that you can sink a lot of hours into and this is definitely one of them
-I like all of the boss designs and the story although a little confusing at some points, was very interesting and I liked the fact you can become Elden Lord that's a pretty sick ending.
-So many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ choices when it comes to customizing your character from looks to abilities and sorceries or weapons. Which I enjoyed very much to see which weapon or spell may work better for an opponent or maybe using a shield could help, or just the fact you can make your character look like a dofus.
-I like the risk and reward that comes from defeating bosses, the rush you feel after losing 3 or 5 hours of you life is amazing, or the pain you suffer after risking the beans and losing 200,000 runes then you want to kys. But thats just like every other fromsoftware game so thats a +

-Cons
-AOE attacks imo are very annoying in this game, some bosses like to spam their AOE attacks a couple times which can be frustrating
-INPUT I really don't know the specific term but in the game when you attempt to heal or cast a spell/sorcery the enemy is programmed to read that input of you healing/spell/sorcery and immediately attack you, while you are in the animation of healing/ casting a spell/sorcery. Which is very annoying.
-You get one-shotted a lot for basically anything under what is it 40 vigor i think.
-Facing two enemies in this game, you will not get a break or if you do you better capitalize on it , for the godskin duo they would both execute various moves and combos at me at the same time but I mean that was with pretty much every other team of 2 as well.
-Some things just seem unnecessary will fighting bosses for ex: imo when fighting commander Naill, when he summons the two knights to fight for him that ♥♥♥♥ is just annoying not even interesting or fun to fight consider the knight with the 2 swords is a mega chad. Melania's heal just seems stupid to me when they also add an undodgeable combo(Waterfowl Dance) that she can use anytime while fighting you. Okay so some people can dodge it but I bet the majority can't which is fine I guess when you can just cheese her with Rivers of blood katana :D.
-Balancing as a whole in terms of weapons and bosses seems weird sometimes ( some bosses are insanely easy for a mage build but then for a samurai could be insanely hard vice versa.) For example, the tree sentinel can block magic such as glinestone pebble and fire it back at you, but then for lets say Godrick I got him on my second try using mage but took me like I would say 45+ tries on my first playthough using a samurai build.

Overall:

I did really enjoy this game and was probably one of the better games I've played in 10+ years, tbh if they added an easy mode in this game that would just be stupid that would take away any form of accomplishment from the game. I give Elden Ring a 8.5/10!";84.7;1.0;0.0;104.0;Posted: May 20

I ve never played a FromSoftware game before and I did find Elden Ring difficult most of the times, but the fact that you are free to roam in the open world whenever and wherever you want, having so much flexibility, was a clincher for me. 130 hours without beginning to feel tired (and also no performance related problems).";132.5;1.0;0.0;17.0;Posted: May 22

So just completed the game yesterday and wow, what an absolutely amazing ride. The amount of work and love that went into this game is honestly insane. I have played Dark Souls 1-3 and Sekiro, and while they are still great games and I picked up Dark Souls 1 again and it completely holds up, you can clearly see that his game has surpassed all its predeccessors.

I love exploring in games and being rewarded by doing so by finding items and secrets where no many people would thought to look, and Elden Ring it's the best representation of this feeling being accomplished. The verticality is unbelievable, there are huge cities with many levels to explore. What Cyberpunk's verticality should have been, this game nails it. The combat is very much the same as previous entries, although your mount, torrent, does offer a new way of fighting sometimes, and the jump it's not only for outside combat, you can dodge attacks by jumping. So cool.

Then comes the story and lore. Many people say the they don't like a story that is not as apparent and on your face as this one. That is totally fine. But the worldbuilding and lore in this game will probably surpass any other game that depends only on dialogue. Because this game has also dialogue, albeit not that much (although more than previous entries), and then you have the world itself that tells you a story, the description on every item, and I mean every item, will tell you more about the game. It's incredible how amazing the worldbuilding and narrative are. Plus the story, while being very similar to Dark Souls stories, does have a few different changes that make it really interesting.

I got burned up of the game at around the 110 hours, and I became interested in the game again at about 112 hours, because you can feel and see that the game is arriving to its conclusion. And its pretty much only epic from then onwards.

To anyone interested in the game and that wants to have a challenging experience with great lore, story, dialogue (the voice actors are top notch), combat and exploration, this game is perfect to you.

For those of you who want to relax playing games, do not buy this game. There is nothing wrong with it, but don't fall into the hype, you will not relax in this game, especially if its your first entry into the series. This way you will save money and dissapointment. The game is great but if you deal with a lot of stress on life and you use games to relax, as I have said many people do so (I do so but I have my space and love of Dark Souls game), this is not for you.";149.0;1.0;0.0;231.0;Posted: May 16

this was my first intro to any souls like game, at the start it was difficult to learn the controls but that's what made it fun. it teaches you that failure is very common but trying again and again rewards you more than you think, but once you achieve victory, those failures are what make the victory so much better. There is so much content, lore, character development, and as much action as you can fathom, the arsenal is so large that iv'e played through the game at least once and i still am finding new weapons. The Class system works great but it also wont stop you from building you're own class from the ground up, you can choose a mage class but build it into a melee tank class, the ability to be free and do whatever you want is one of, if not the greatest ability you can have in the game, and the multiplayer is picky, but it's also quite fun. 10/10 love it, worth the money";223.0;1.0;0.0;73.0;Posted: May 19

Not a 10/10 circle jerking masterpiece. Several issues such as weapons feeling the same, the open world makes the experience worse imo, some of the bosses not fitting too well with the DS3 style of combat (which we already saw with for example Friede which baffles me they copied DS3 and decided to make more bosses like this, rather than not doing that or changing the combat style to fit more). I had little trouble and low death counts for 99% of the bosses, so it is not that I need to ""git gud"". For your first playthrough, it's an easy ~9/10. After that, it's like an ~8/10.";100.8;1.0;0.0;29.0;Posted: May 18

Quite honestly the best open world game I have ever played.
Not since the Witcher 3 have I been so immersed in a world, and pretty much every element works amazingly. The graphics, locations, visual design of the bosses, enemies, NPCs, locations etc is just phenomenal, honestly FS best work.
The story is cryptic as always but has that visual storytelling which FS excels at.
The gameplay is absolutely amazing and very addicting. It keeps all the expected challenge from previous games but offers a lot of versatility in how to overcome the challenges, making it the most accessible game in FromSofts library.
Finally, there is so much here, its so close to being overwhelming, but never feels overbearing. I am near the endgame and I still feel like I have barely touched the surface of this massive massive game.

For fans of open world games, fantasy games, action games, RPGs, fans of Visual Storytelling and of course the downright masochistic. This may be a From Software game, but it is honestly a game I can recommend to everyone. Its one of the best games I've ever played and an absolute masterpiece. I'm gonna go right back to playing it after this review lmao";156.0;1.0;0.0;129.0;Posted: May 19

I am almost 50 hours in but I only have 19% achievement.

Okay maybe the alts that I've made (about 10 or so at this point omegalul) do not help that I'm not progressing much into the mid-late game

BUT

The fact that my main is around level 80 and I STILL HAVEN'T FOUGHT THE BIG GUY ON THE SMALL HORSE THAT CAN SHOOT METEORS AT ME (the guy shoots the meteors not the horse) means I still have a bazillion things I can do in this game

and that makes me moisty

P.S. Bleed/Hemorrage is probably the best status effect to have in the early game, so get your ass to Fort Haight as soon as possible and get the Bloody Slash. Pop it into your main slashing weapon (if you don't have one that's tough on you mate) and start murdering trolls for the LULZ";67.4;1.0;0.0;183.0;Posted: May 17

The game is very challenging in some ways and keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. Beautiful graphics and game play. I don't think I've had this much fun playing a game since the early days of Skyrim and that says a lot, for me anyways. I love how there is so many different ways to create a build and the different spells etc. The creation is endless. If you're waiting for it to go on sale, don't.

Fantastic game. Personally I found it too difficult in the early phases, and there is very little in the way of direction. There is hard and there is straight up frustrating, and this game often crosses it. Finally I got fed up and just modded the difficulty. Best decision ever. As the game got easier and I leveled up, I just increased the difficulty gradually back to standard. Yeah I know, all you purists. Git Gud, yes. I play to have fun, and if it's too hard to be fun?? I'll just make it less hard.

But the aesthetic is awesome, the world is massive, plenty of mystery and combat/RPG system allows for purposeful play rather than just pure dodge and block timing. Great game.";78.5;1.0;0.0;29.0;Posted: May 18

This is my first From Software game, all the previous ones put me off with the brutal difficulty. Once I heard about the ability to level up your character by farming to make the bosses easier in this game it felt like the game for me. I am not a hardcore gamer in terms of skills, I normally hate boss battles, but have only been playing this a couple of days and have killed some mini bosses and am not far from killing the first major boss - not killed it yet, but the battle is the best boss battle I have ever played. I am using the Astrologer Mage class and the magic spells mean I can do a lot of damage from a distance which is making the game a lot easier for me.

The game is beautiful and atmospheric, you can tell a lot of love went into making it.

Am only 2 days in, but am hooked, it is a joy to play.";35.0;1.0;0.0;749.0;Posted: May 18

This is a game full of flaws. Its qualities, however, are so overwhelming that no amount of negative points would change my rating to Bad. This game is the culmination of everything From has developed in their previous titles, it is better in every aspect (perhaps not in the technical sense, but maybe I'm the lucky guy that has not experienced the performance issues everyone is rambling about).";104.2;1.0;0.0;348.0;Posted: May 17

Great world building, game mechanics, but clunky user-interface compared with typical PC-first game designs. Presumably, it plays just fine on console or simply works as a result of controller's limitations compared with mouse-and-keyboard control schemes, But it will take hours for PC gamers to get used to. That quitting game and inventory access, quick slot assignment are all nested in the same ESC menu structure is just weird. Map doesn't scroll up/down or pan left/right with mouse movement but requires WASD to move. Story-wise, Elden Ring is a typical JRPG-rooted IP with hard-to-follow story logic, (too) short on exposition, but long on obscure references for players to puzzle out.";52.2;1.0;0.0;6.0;Posted: May 19

This game is exceptional. I don't play a ton of singleplayer games and I've never touched a soulslike game before this so I wasn't sure if I'd really enjoy Elden Ring; I was so wrong. The open world, the characters, the combat, all of it was amazing. I spent 133 hours (I like to take my time, don't judge me) on my first playthrough and enjoyed every minute of it.

If you're hesitating to buy this game because you're worried it might be too hard I'd say worry not. It's not like the game isn't difficult, enemies hit hard and can be unforgiving at times, but rarely did encounters feel genuinely unfair. For every challenge that Elden Ring throws at you it offers a solution, be that a weapon, a spell, an ash of war, a spirit summon or even a craftable item. I wholeheartedly recommend embracing as many of these tools as possible and finding out what makes the game fun for you. This game definitely asks a lot of you, there are rules about the pace and feel of combat you'll only understand after some time playing, but I promise that if you're willing to learn a bit, meet the game halfway and play by its rules, you'll have a great time.";158.9;1.0;0.0;23.0;Posted: May 18

OK, I kind of have quite a bit to say. I think this game is just meh but I WOULD recommend it. You can make fun of me all you want but I think that this game is HARD, I am not trashing on the game but it is just not my pace. It is not dark-souls hard but this game is definitely frustrating to me. If you are into this kind of fast paced fantasy games then by all means this is the game for you, but if you are the latter then you probably should just save your money. I do think this game is graphically stunning, It is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. For now I will wait for my refund and just play skyrim.";0.9;1.0;0.0;4.0;Posted: May 16

I'm pleasantly surprised by the game. It has some new features not seen before in Souls games. Crafting, crouching, jumping, a map, day/night cycle.

The graphics on HDR are beautiful, with colors coming to life and any cave sections very atmospheric with pitch black passages to go through. The world, of which I've seen only a little yet, seems to have lots to explore. There are a lot of optional bosses also, and lots of crafting items to collect.

The combat seems a little more fast paced than in older Souls games, which is a good thing. Normal mobs can ruin your day if you aren't careful. The bosses are definitely more of a challenge than in DS 2, which I completed previous to ER.

For performance, on AMD 5800x, 3090 and an M.2 SSD I have little complaints. An occasional short stutter maybe once a half hour which does nothing to ruin the experience. Your mileage may vary, though. Possibly wouldn't play well on a barely minimum spec PC.

At first I wasn't planning on buying this, but now I'm glad I did. If you feel you're getting wrecked time and time again, slow down your playing and think more what you're doing. Learn from your mistakes and use the tools available to you!

Performance:
Not great, but playable. Generally hovers between 40 to 50 fps, can drop to 30 sometimes (rare). Same with stuttering (rare).

Gameplay:
People new to this style of games may have a difficult time getting started with this game. I recommend looking up a walkthrough guide to set you up and give u a headstart. After that game has good balance of difficult enemies, but beatable if you explore and gain more levels. Map is massive with lots of things to do/explore. I have about 40 hours so far and I'm maybe 30-40% complete.";45.7;1.0;0.0;21.0;Posted: May 18

so at first this game is pretty hard, even more for non dark souls players like me :) but as you progress more into the game, to the mid game, this game really starts to make some sense and you know what you are doing, in the early game its pretty fun because this game lets you explore as much as you want, but overall this game really was for me a 10/10 definetly, there are so many things you can do, side quests and much more its really one of the best games i have ever played";102.8;1.0;0.0;13.0;Posted: May 22

♥♥♥♥♥♥ Amazing game every complained about how hard it was and how some bosses are unfair or to aggressive or to passive. I like to look at it like this its a hard fair and fun game with allot to do. have many many ways to play and enjoy from being a high dps dagger build to an uber tank with duel giant shields boarder line immune to damage. this game isnt hard every boss can be dealt with and every problem has an actual solution that the devs didnt just pull out of nowhere. yes there can be some issues with story being to fast or short depending on what your doing but then again there is an actual new game plus. personally. i feel like a souls game only starts once you his new game plus. thats when things get hard but still in a fun way. you have no real excuse to not want to play this game other than you dont like the story rich yet mostly earned type or story telling if you treat this like dark souls your will struggle if you treat it like bloodborne or sekiro its gonna feel to slow at times. just play this and learn. i promise you wont really regret it unless this type of game just inst your cup of tea or coffee.";25.5;1.0;0.0;475.0;Posted: May 18

This is my first From Software title, and while the game is extremely tough as expected from the reputation of the developer, it is also fair. I don't consider myself a hardcore gamer, and I've already sunk over 100 hours into the game, and love exploring is expansive world. The amount of times the game has surprised me (delightedly and otherwise) is pretty amazing.

Definitely worth playing, the open world is really well crafted and bosses are fun. It can be as easy or as difficult as you want it to be, since there are lots of ways you can play this game 😘

A game that is truly a masterpiece. No wrong way to play it. I was methodical going through the lands between, some would say overly methodical. But i had a blast finding little items, solving puzzles and beating mini bosses at the ends of secret dungeons.

So many weapons to choose from, I was spoiled for choice. Your build dictates a little bit of what you can use but with an easy re-spec system pretty early on it was rarely an issue.

I was on the fence about buying Elden Ring, but I really wanted a game with action combat and interesting bosses. How bad can it be, I thought? Well, I'm sure it's great for Soulsborne fans, but if (like me) you just wanted something that was exciting without being a slog, stay away.

I'm not wholly unenthusiastic--the art direction and visual style is good, and if they fixed the numerous things I am about to list below as the problems I had, then I would genuinely enjoy the combat. I'm also told that previous games by this publisher used to be even less accessible, so progress, kind of, I guess?

But there are a lot of flaws I've already butted into with only a few hours of playtime (anyone who wants to tell me to ""git gud"" or similar should be aware there is a special circle of Hell for those who demand people treat their leisure time like a job).
--Co op with friends comes with mandatory PvP attackers you cannot opt out of. Also, no form of scaling is available to make co op with higher level friends more functional if you are starting out.
--Currency and XP are the same thing, and both are lost on death. You can theoretically reclaim them, but only within a limited window, and there is no bank. Period.
--If you die, in addition to the loss of resources already mentioned, you may not be able to get to the enemy that killed you to learn how to better deal with them for a while, because pulling too many enemies at once will just murder you so you need to approach every fight cautiously--and therefore time-consumingly. Add to this that the theoretically great build variety comes with all sorts of animation details you need to learn, and you're going to be spending a lot of time in loading screens and carefully approaching enemy camps and the like.
--There are no difficulty settings of any kind, which would be a thing that would allow the good of the game to shine through without making it disrespect the player's time availability nearly so much.

Overall, this is a game I very much want to like and simply cannot. More power to those who can, but I want to warn those who like me, were tempted by the acclaim into thinking it might be a decent casual dip of a game, rather than a lifestyle you adopt for months.

Addendum: I was able to do a ton of external research and conversations with friends and get to the point where I am enjoying the game now. I stand by my original review, however, as the game should not require that level of external resource use.";55.8;0.0;3.0;92.0;Posted: May 16

Play Dark Souls instead, the world is fun and expansive but the bosses are pretty ♥♥♥♥, boring, and kinda BS, a lot use tracking attacks and double combos so you often can't avoid them (which doesn't help that they have large health pools and high damage output). If you want a fair but hard fight this isn't the game, there's just way too much BS with those attacks that really just make the fight RNG rather than a matter of skill.

Difficulty is much to insane. To start right off the rip and make it so hard is a quick turn off. I would much rather the game progress you into the difficulty than make it right from the start so hard you wanna smash your controller. Some may like the games and the ones before it. It's a huge no for a lot of players. Relaxing is tagged on this title and that is a big lie.";2.1;0.0;0.0;340.0;Posted: May 23

Requested refund after one hour of watching reload screens after death over and over. Why do people think this is fun? Battle mechanics are weird and slow. You can't run, so getting anywhere takes forever and its almost impossible to get away when you're in trouble. Camera feels super wonky to me also. It's difficult to keep track of enemies and you're dead from one hit most of the time, so that's basically the end. I guess people are into that sort of thing, but it was unclear how to actually make progress and that's just no fun for me. I'm assuming it would get better as I leveled up, but it's not worth $60 to spend a whole day not having fun just in case I might later, lol.

Before you get mad, I genuinely wanted to like this game. I wanted to throw myself into it and go all in. I didn't play Dark Souls so I wasn't so impressed by the clunky mechanics. There are barely PC setting for the keyboard layout and the gamepad only seems to support XBox controller display.
The artwork in the cut scenes and story narration were great. I normally don't have the attention span for cinematics but these were worthy and pleasing.
Character creation sucks. Not good. Terrible presets. Awful customization. If you don't care about that you should be fine. Every person you chose no matter what you do, you end up looking like a potato head. No thanks.
Not a true open world RPG. No NPCs or towns. So weak.
Who ever stated that this was the game of the year must be new to video games.
Very 2016 IMO.
I should have trusted my instinct and waited until it was on sale for $19.99. Even Cyberpunk wasn't this bad and Cyberpunk launch was a disaster.
I would say that it could get better in a year or two but I doubt it will, unless they redo the entire game.
On the other hand, Elden Ring made me appreciate my other games more.

The graphics, combat mechanics, and story in this game is far outclassed by the older witcher 3. After playing cyberpunk, far cry 6, this game just seemed outdated.

I've played what I consider to be a decent amount of the game. Got about as far as Leyndell before deciding I'd had enough of the nonsense. Elden Ring is far and away from being a good game. A beautiful-yet-boring world stuffed with repetitive filler to make the game look like there's a lot of content when really it's just copy/pasted enemies filling in a pretty backdrop. No joke, that's all you do: run around a big empty world and kill enemies and even bigger enemies. Oh, and die a lot.

Yes, this game is difficult. Yes, I went into this knowing that FromSoftware games are notoriously hard. I didn't think I'd mind that because I love a good challenge. But there's a HUGE different between being difficult and being straight-up immersion-breaking. And Elden Ring is a whole lot of the latter. Enemies and bosses can one- or two-shot you even if you've leveled up a significant amount. Even if you've gotten better weapons or upgraded your existing ones. Even if you went and found an NPC or Ashes of War or even another player to summon to your aid. No matter how many hours you spend grinding runes. No matter how many times you try to parry or dodge or heal or even cheese, all of which are at many times impossible to do because the enemies and bosses are just too fast and too unpredictable. At some point they've killed you so many times that it becomes more of a chore than a game.

And then there's the storytelling, which in and of itself is virtually nonexistent and should more or less be labeled ""loreytelling"". There's a ton of exposition in the beginning cutscene, and then you're just told to go become Elden Lord. No reason why, just go do it because that's the game. But beyond that, there's no unfolding, driven narrative. No characters worth giving a crap about. No plot twists or emotional moments or anything that makes the player WANT to continue. All there is is worldbuilding and an egregious amount of it that most people will probably miss. The game doesn't even tell you what the purpose of any of this is. WHY do I need to claim the title of Elden Lord? WHY is the Erdtree important and not simply the biggest freaking MacGuffin I've ever laid eyes on? WHAT is the point?

I don't particularly care what excuses anyone has defending this game's insulting lack of story. Lore and story are two very different things, not interchangeable synonyms. If Elden Ring were a novel, it'd be one of the worst-written novels I've ever heard of.

The last major issue I have with this game is the dungeon design. Maybe I'm spoiled by the dungeons of Zelda, but these ""dungeons"" are little more than fortresses filled with a ton of enemies and little else. Whether it's the big main dungeons or the smaller castles or even the stuff underground, everything is routinely the same. The big dungeons at least have different visual appearances to them, but there's so few of them compared to the tons of copy-pasted smaller dungeons that it almost doesn't matter. None of these dungeons are memorable in any sense of the word.

The only real aspects of Elden Ring that I can confidently consider pros are the gorgeous graphics and the stellar soundtrack. If even half as much effort went into making the rest of the game that good, I wouldn't be as upset at it. But in no conceivable way can I recommend this game. It just does not live up to the hype surrounding it.";40.2;0.0;2.0;101.0;Posted: May 23

If you like souls games, I assume you'll like this game. But if you didn't like Dark Souls and friends, don't bother with this game. I see lots of people saying, ""This time it's different! If you don't like souls games because you keep dying, just run around and become super-powerful in the new open world before you fight any bosses, then they'll all be a breeze!""

I find this notion that I will become powerful enough to breeze through every ""boss"" very hard to believe.(*)
This advice sounds like, ""grind your life away picking up power-ups for hours before you get to start to play the game in a meaningful way"", which is not a great sales pitch IMHO.

Some people love these kind of games, and I'm really happy for them, as I've heard they really like this game—the pinnacle of the genre, perhaps.

I'm just here to say: if you didn't like Dark Souls et al., you're most likely not going to like this game.

The game gets very annoying after a while, which is compounded by the fact that you can't quit to desktop.
Quit brings you back to the main menu, with a text pop up you need to close; all before you can scroll down and quit. Controls are clunky in the sense that multi-key registry appears to be almost non-existent. I find myself desperately mashing the button to heal, but unable to do so because I'm still walking backwards or something. It doesn't do it every time either, which makes it that much more annoying.

I'm still going to play it, I guess. I must hate myself or something.

Sure would be nice if they put a little more effort into making this a PC game though. Quit to desktop is some pretty basic stuff. Sometimes I alt-f4 and don't even care about the consequences though--this is that type of game.";24.7;0.0;1.0;75.0;Posted: May 20

Now listen, I may be screaming into the wind for no reason. But I cannot deal with this game. From the constant lag spikes (FYI, my hardware is not the issue. I can play Witcher 3 on mostly best settings and get 60 FPS from it, meanwhile I still got constant lag spikes on this with all settings on lowest) and the story making nearly no sense along with the Sekiro-like difficulty, I refuse.

Best way I can describe this is they took the boss difficulty of Sekiro and threw it into Dark Souls and it just doesn't mesh well at all. Some bosses like Godrick were a joke, while Margit was extremely tough. I lost my will to play this when I got to the Leonine Misbegotten & Crucible Knight duo-boss, failed a ♥♥♥♥-ton of times, finally beat it only to be told I wasted my time and I can't get to Radahn. As I thought: Closer to beginning of game = easier areas. But nope.

As for the story? I've tried to get into it and understand it, but it just doesn't click well with me at all. I may be missing things but it mostly seems like the writer was a senile man they hired and only kept his story due to some type of sunk cost fallacy. Cause I really don't get it after researching for around 3 hours in some vain attempt to like the game. And most of what I've seen are people insisting the game is clever and interesting, yet if you think about it then it really doesn't work. So this is basically Bioshock Infinite all over again.

I wanted a Dark Souls 4 (spiritually), instead I got Sekiro 1.5. And I already wasn't very fond of Sekiro.
And before you say ""Git gud"", I've beaten all three Dark Souls several times and beaten Demon Souls once. If I gave up on this game, something's definitely wrong. Sure, it's not impossible but I don't wanna devote time to trying to beat this when my playing experience so far has been more miserable than all three Dark Souls games combined.";60.5;0.0;5.0;243.0;Posted: May 17

I wish I could put a 'maybe' recommendation. My issue is that the game mainly uses one CPU core, so even if your CPU does great with other modern games that use multi-threading, it may not be enough for this poorly optimized PC port. However, other than low FPS caused by the avoidable bottleneck, I didn't have any noticeable glitches or stutters, and the first hour or so was fun. I'll probably pick it up later on down the line when it's cheaper and I can run it at a solid 60.";1.9;0.0;0.0;382.0;Posted: May 16

I want to love this game but it has some very glaring issues that make me unable to recommend it. The boss design is terrible, some of the worst in any game I've played ranging from bosses that do extremely long, almost impossible to avoid combos that end in delayed AoEs so melee players can't get in, or the boss will fly completely across a huge map constantly so you're chasing and dodging for an eternity hoping to get 1 hit in or the boss is made that you can only attack if you take damage but all the bosses hit like a nuke, even with full vigor most bosses can take half your health in 1 hit, but ranged players aren't home free either, there are bosses that are completely resistant to magic, story bosses that are immune or heal from things like holy damage so if you tried to make a faith build around holy damaging weapons or spells, your journey ends here because that story boss is completely immune to you and the fight would be hard already for a build that can actually damage it with their best stuff. The worst part is, the worst offenders of the bad design issue are mandatory story bosses, like a certain someone who's name rhymes with Margaret or the star that shall not be named, if you played the game more than a few hours you know. There are also lots of dungeons that lock you in with no way to get out but fighting, no indication on the level or anything so exploring, it is entirely possible to end up stuck somewhere with no way to get out because you're not strong enough to fight, including a trap right in the starting area that could very easily have you stuck if you don't know the path to get out. then you add in bad patches where they remove access to upgrades or things that just made certain mandatory encounters manageable on all builds while leaving in extremely bad things that some bosses can do that they very clearly shouldn't and the community complains about nonstop, or things like PvP that is awful and you're left with a fun but fatally flawed game. It has a lot of good but when the worst part of a Souls game is the bosses, there is a big issue.";152.4;0.0;3.0;8.0;Posted: May 17

Imagine releasing a game in 2022 with fps locked to 60. 60fps, 60hz. No FOV slider either. On top of that it's poorly optimized too.

It's a game clearly developed for last-gen consoles, devs are too clueless to properly port it over to PC. Either clueless or lazy, trash devs.

I went from Destiny 2's (2017), smooth 240fps 240hz + fov slider gameplay to Elden Ring's (2022) stuttering 60fps 60hz fishbowl FOV gameplay. 10/10 experience.

I was not aware of these issues when buying Elden Ring because it's not something you look into. I literally can't think of any recent release suffering from issues dating back to 2009. It's a joke. There's no point in reviewing the actual gameplay when they can't even get the basics right. Don't buy this on PC until they get their **** together.";0.7;0.0;1.0;152.0;Posted: May 22

The PC version on the other hand was a tragedy, from pacing issues to random disconnects and crashes the game experience was abysmal!

I've extensively played Sekiro and DS1-3 , with multiple play throughs.
In contrast, the few really tough bosses in Elden Ring need excess RNG to win (without investing ridiculous time mastering or using cheese), and you miss that sense of reward from predicting a bosses moveset (also in sekiro's case, new skills help tip the battle in your favour in balanced ways). Certain bosses in Elden Ring feel more like a chore than a challenge.

Three other key related issues: too many copypasta enemies/bosses, crazy input reading, and overly delayed attacks. The latter two make fights feel like you're facing a computer code more than anything. There are still some wonderful areas and bosses, just not as many with the calibre of other souls games.";92.2;0.0;0.0;14.0;Posted: May 22

Feels a little bit wrong to give a bad review considering the amount of hours I've put in and the more hours I'm going to.
But here's my take on it.

Good:
Combat is awesome. Hack and slash and going melee will definitely test your skills. You feel like you become better the more you learn about the enemy pattern and how to fight them. Even the hardest hitting enemies will feel like ants when you've farmed them 20 times.






































I've enjoyed far more from Zelda Breath of the Wild 5 hours in, compared to my 52.6 hours in Elden Ring.
Right now, I'm just FORCING MYSELF to play it because if I don't, I will lose all the knowledge, skills, quests that I know right at this very moment and will then either need to re-play the whole 50 hours, or just continue off blind again. And restart building my skills again.
The game is good. But the developers design decisions to keep this as ""Souls series by FROM SOFTWARE"", really lets this game potential to an ultimate down. What, a, shame.

When the AI abide by the same rules that the player does, with more effort being put towards quality of game play and less direct attempts by the developer to kill the player, I will reinstall. As is, any issue found with the game is met with ""git gud"" instead of the proper criticism being levied towards the developers. A borderline game breaking mechanic shouldn't be dealt with, it should be removed. It isn't difficult or challenging, it is asinine and irritating.
A minor gripe, the quality of bosses is far more important than the quantity.";41.0;0.0;3.0;189.0;Posted: May 21

Some of the areas are fun, but not the others.

After 60+ hours of playtime, I can say this is my least favorite game from FROMSOFTWARE. Now this is completely personal and I expect people to disagree, that's fine, but I'll still explain why I think this is their worst game. (Note that I have not played Demon's Souls or Bloodborne because I'm not buying a Playstation just for those games. I only cleared DS1 once but cleared DS2, DS3 and Sekiro multiple times each, so I don't think this is a ""git gud"" issue.)

The two main problems I have with the game are parts of the open world and the (not always but way too often) godawful enemy design.

The open world is beautiful and offers lots of options to the player, which at first glance is very nice right ? Well, it turns out that this same open worlds comes in to butcher what other souls games have been pretty great at executing : difficulty progression. Yes, in other games you could stumble upon an area you were not supposed to clear yet and get destroyed by the enemies in there, but there was a limited set of possibilities in terms of new areas that were accessible to you at a time. In Elden Ring however, you have infinite possibilities. Therefore, the pattern that starts to occur when you enter a new area is ""Either I wreck everything in here or they wreck me"". This makes for a mediocre experience at best because if something is too hard, you just walk out and go somewhere else until you find something you can actually clear. The fact that the game is so open also doesn't really fit a souls game. Maybe that's just me ? I feel like exploring should be sort of relaxing and laid back but then you find some cool ruins and you need to activate tryhard
mode to clear it. Kinda breaks the rythm of the game in my opinion. Also it kinda kills one of my favorite aspects from the Dark Souls series : the claustrophobia inducing level design. (Obviously we can still find that in the legacy dungeons which are AMAZING in both presentation and level design. There's a reason why those are by far my favorite part of the game.)

Now on the topic of the enemy design, it's been pointed out a lot already but I've heard that the enemy design was very inspired by Bloodborne enemies. You'll remember from earlier that I did NOT play Bloodborne but I did play Sekiro and I'd say that some enemies very much do feel like they were taken straight out of Sekiro and slapped into Elden Ring with no adjustments whatsoever while WE only have a DS1 moveset at our disposal. Some of them are just way too fast, some of them keep on attacking for so long you can grow a 6ft long beard before they stop and some do both. This makes for some of the most frustrating encounters I've had in any game I've played and, mostly for that reason alone, I think this game is way, way worse than all their previous games. Also don't get me started on double boss fights. It's like they picked out the pairings at random.

As I said before, the open world is insanely gorgeous and very fun to explore, but there's still this weird feeling that the game shouldn't switch from ""pleasant exploration"" to ""absolute sweatfest"" in an instant, but then again it's not THAT big of an issue. The real problem really resides in the enemy design which is really flawed in certain areas of the game. I sometimes feel like I was given a toothpick to go fight a tank. That's unfortunately not something I can enjoy.

I'm interested to hear your opinions. Are they different ? Do you agree with some of my points ?

Personally, I didn't get much out of Elden Ring. The open world could be interesting at times, and there were some interesting bosses, but for the most part I find it rather boring and think that most of what this game has to offer was done far better in the prior Soulsbourne games. The overall gameplay / boss mechanics feel rather poorly done in some aspects (huge attack delays, AoE spam, tons of frenzied attacks, etc.) and makes some fights a slog to get through. If you find that fun, great, but I much prefer the more methodical fights in the prior FromSoftware titles where learning your enemy was a far more straightforward endeavor.";20.2;0.0;3.0;380.0;Posted: May 17

I used to like soulsborne games, but I played the entire thing and enjoyed maybe 30 minutes of it. The remaining 93 hours were not fun. The game plays like every other soulsborne but with more obnoxious enemies. The only parts I actually enjoyed were: the first dragon fight, the fire giant and Melania. It was not worth it. It is not worth your time or your money.

There are lots of little reasons I could go into, but I doubt anyone cares. According to the internet it's the best game evvaar. Until the next big thing, then it will be forgotten, like so many others. If even 1 person listens to me and doesn't buy it or uninstalls it, I will consider that 1 life I helped make better.

Please consider, instead of playing Elden Ring go outside. Take up woodworking. Go sailing. Fall in love. Play a different game. Live your life. You deserve better than this.";93.5;0.0;1.0;72.0;Posted: May 19

When you spend a lot of money it is always a worry if the game is going to be good especially if refund is not an option. Will the game hook you and make you want to play, will you get the ""yes this is gona be good!!!"" feeling ""I'm glad I paid this much"" or will it not and sit on your shelf collecting dust? I've played 0.6hrs at time of review and it is not looking good. If a game goes not hook me from the start and give me that feeling i'm too old to bother with it. Entertainment should not be a chore I have to work for in the hope of maybe I will be entertained at a later date..

The game intro is a series of 2d still drawing with voiceover. There are lots of words and images that mean nothing, are nonsensical, explain nothing and do absolutely nothing to hook you and get you pumped for the game. The only reason I can come up with is if someone thought this was a way to create mystery, is a drunk guys rambles mysterious er no. If this was the aim they should have just started the game, no intro just dump you in the world, that would create some mystery. Or get someone with some talent in to make a good intro.

Ok you start the game and by now some voiceover has said you want to find this ring. I don't know who I am or why I want it, no back story nothing, how do I know I even want it? Who knows maybe a guy in a pub said it would look nice on me. Saying my character wants something with no context is not mystery guys it is just dumb.

You find messages str8 away everywhere that mean nothing and are nonsensical, explain nothing and do absolutely nothing to hook you. You find a finger that explains you can use that to write messages for other players to see. So all these messages on the floor everywhere are just rubbish other players have written. Next step start googling how to turn that off. Everyone just loves having to google settings a few mins into a game right, getting soo hooked now guys well done.

This game is meant to be good. If I can be bothered to force myself to play more and find that out and can get over the terrible terrible terrible start I will change my review.";1.4;0.0;1.0;133.0;Posted: May 22

Not as immersive or beautiful for me, as I'd expected based on the hype and reviews.

I've just started avoiding the bosses. Wen't back to a boss in west limgrave at level 27, but I still got thrashed. I've only managed to kill one ""boss"" and that was on horseback. The controller response during fights is sluggish, but that seems by design based on what I've read. (I have a good max equipment weight to equipment weight ratio) I try blocking, parrying, and dodging, and use quick and heavy blows, but when I die I've hardly scratched the boss (and lost my runes because they drop in the instance).

It just gets so annoying repeatedly dying and having to kill the same things over and over again. Other people see this as a way of levelling, but for me it's just annoying and it breaks the immersion.

I normally play with kb and mouse, but I'm using a ps controller for Elden Ring because I read so many bad reviews for kb and mouse in ER.

Other than that, it's fun killing random mobs and exploring but if you're a old-school RPG gamer, then think twice, especially at the price.

I've carried on playing to see if it gets better and reached 20 hours, so I can't get a refund. So I'll probably continue playing and just explore and avoid the bosses, just to try and get my money's worth.

Honestly not that fun on PC. Great reviews so I was excited to play this game. I enjoy the challenging nature of the fights. It's obvious that an incredible amount of care and attention has gone into making this game, which I appreciate. But a few choices make it kind of irritating. I never know what the heck I'm supposed to do. Many other large, open world games have some kind of quest tracking system, typically integrated with the map. I've got over 30 hours into the game and I don't know if I'm working toward the main story or not. The artwork is intricate and highly stylized, but seems too whimsical for me. Everything has a fairy tale, dreamlike quality. It's also clearly designed for consoles. I purchased the steam version for PC and literally wasn't able to get through character creation since by default all the controls are for console. I needed to Google instructions to change the defaults to use keyboard and mouse. Is it so hard for the devs to make the PC version default to using PC for input? It seems more like the game designers just don't care about the player's convenience or happiness. The quick slot system makes it very hard on PC to change between for example sometimes using a bow and sometimes using a sword and shield combo. Finally there's no way to pause the game. If you're playing, I hope you don't get a phone call or have a roommate or child that needs help, because your character will just die since you cannot pause. Why? Maybe I'll try to load up some mods to make it more user friendly for PC... For reference, I have not played Darksouls or any other FromSoftware games, so maybe I'm struggling with a one-time learning curve. Other games I like include the Witcher Series, Assassin's Creed series, Elder Scrolls series, particularly Skyrim which is probably my favorite game. Anyway, I hope this review is useful.";71.7;0.0;2.0;13.0;Posted: May 19

Game feels like it's overwhelmingly difficult ALWAYS - we all get these games are intended to be challenging for the best of us but all I feel I'm doing in this is grinding till I can pass areas. At a glance it's a pretty solid title, once you get invested though it's basically a regret.

It basically boils down to -
Enter area, kill enemy / on success repeat.
if killed, grind, repeat step 1.

The world is ""open"" but there's not a ♥♥♥ thing to do so who cares? after you play a few hours you've basically seen the entire game just imagine bigger enemies as you go. Yawn. I'd love my 60$ back but I already wasted to much time. I fully get 99% of folks reading this will be all ""nah, get good!"" but....this is a ♥♥♥♥ game.

As a person who very much enjoys Souls games, I don't feel like Fromsoft really care about balancing their game. You just simply can't find good pvp match ups anymore in invasions and everyone just uses one-shot builds. But to make matters worse, the servers for Elden Ring are completely garbage and you can't go an hour without being disconnected from your friends unlike in the Dark Souls titles. The actual pve of Elden Ring is incredibly easy and playing the game feels somewhat like a step down from what they had done in Dark Souls 3.

Elden Ring is a poorly optimized console port that is ruined by the forced install of Easy Anti-Cheat. If you prefer not to play games that are excessively difficult and that have the Dark Souls formula of saving only at bonfires with respawning enemies and way too many difficult boss battles then this game is NOT for you. Easy Anti-Cheat causes the game not to work with ANY trainer and it can also cause the game to even stop loading. There is also no campaign or true levels. You just wonder around from boss fight to boss fight with no idea if you are making any progress or not. I also could not play this game in 4k resolution because of constant frame rate drops. 1080p looks grainy and I was still getting frame rate drops using an RTX2080 and i9 processor. There is also no resolution slider and all of the game commands and instructions are for a controller and not a keyboard.

Hey, do you play souls games? You'll love everything about Elden Ring, from the bosses to the playerbase.

Dont play souls games and wanted to give them a try? Don't! The bosses in the game pretty much will own your hide no matter what you try. Want to level up to trying and get stronger to beat a boss? Good luck grinding for days to scrounge enough runes for 1 level after they start reaching 100k per lvl. Or just do like everyone else and grind exploits until the same problem occurs.
Oh, but you think that maybe the community will help you find a build that fits your play style or give help of a boss? Well, aside from every boss being an input reading Ai with a penchant for repeatedly smashing you with the same ability endlessly, whatever advice given will typically be null and void from that fact as well, oh and don't forget to sprinkle some of that GIT GUD stuff on there, the community loves spewing that at anyone who dares suggest a slightly toned down difficulty, its not like you have a life outside the game.

Tldr, ignoring all the rage up above, the game is fun in the open world, but really, don't bother if you want to complete the story, every boss is just a headache that no matter your skill(unless your a sweat) will find some way to piss you off before you kill it.";200.5;0.0;4.0;70.0;Posted: May 19

I would recommend the game to people who are masochists. There are some horrible bosses in this game. The worst being late game, in the coolest areas. Lets take the Fire Giant for example. Mother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fire Giant. I love being challenged, I've beaten dark souls 1-3 and I've beaten Elden Ring. But none of the bosses in any of the DS games (Except Pontiff) have made me cry in anger. This boss kills you with total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In his second phase, most of his attacks screw you over because every attack has some sort of long-ass flame particle ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that blocks your vision. Not to mention the constant belly flopping and rolling. On top of all of this, he always waves his arms around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lunatic and you can hardly hit his weak spot. He can also randomly roll up onto trees in the arena making him impossible to hit. I love Elden ring, but holy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ I need to let out some anger.";166.6;0.0;2.0;50.0;Posted: May 20

If you think I got some detail wrong, feel free to inform me so. Now to the review.


This game is a waste of potential. It takes the fantastic concept of challenging bosses that make you feel godly and are extremely rewarding upon their defeat and removes the ""make you feel godly part"". Ill compare this to hollow knight(Hence, spoilers for hollow knight ahead) since these 2 games share some very similar ending sequences: Radagon-Elden Beast and Hollow Knight-Radiance

In Elden ring, you first have to fight a stupidly unbalanced boss that will hit you with carbon molecules he exhaled from his ass before being able to fight a boss that will keep a distance of 9 marathons from you all while spamming so many projectiles you forget what a projectile even is. Whenever you die you have to go through the stupidly unbalanced boss every time, effectively draining everything you have-potions, summons, you name it, before putting you in another fight.
Now the game I draw comparison to: Hollow Knight. In it, you follow a very similar formula: fight a boss to reach the other one, have to refight the entrance boss every time you die. Now here is the magic of hollow knight: the fight isnt overly challenging in comparison to other fights in the game. The fight is actually very well balanced-all the attacks are perfectly manageable(Im looking at you, Radagon's 10 mile long hammer slam hit-you-with-his-ass hitboxes). Beyond that, Hollow Knight, too, has an invincibility-roll kind of mechanic with it's dashes at that point in the game. So what makes the fight different? Literally everything. Hollow Knight is there(in my opinion, I know a lot of people see it as a big flaw) to make YOU feel hollow. The fight is simple-its just a gate to get to the final boss. If you die to the final boss once, it feels like a punishment, after all, chances are, you got your ass kicked into nothing by the Hollow Knight, but you get progressively better and better at it to the point where you feel like a god, until eventually you fight him so many times the feeling fades away and you are fully focused on defeating radiance, at which point it is you successfully ""contain"" it. Now what happens in Elden Ring in the same exact scenario: you are alive by a single strand of hp with 4 potions as you go into the final boss, you die. You then die to Radagon 7 more times before getting to the boss again, you die. You eventually get good enough where you beat him consistently but it kind of stops there for your average Joe. You get your ass kicked over and over and over. If this is a roleplaying game the role you are playing is the victim of abuse. When I finally defeated the Elden Beast I didnt get a feeling of ""HELL YEAH FINALLY"" like I did with the radiance, rather it was ""finally this fat ♥♥♥♥ is dead"". It felt like a burden. In case you cant see the issue here-Hollow Knight(the boss, not the game itself) was BUILT to be a burden and yet felt 10x less of a burden than whatever the hell Elden Ring has going. And dont even get me started on how bleed-a whole major build type-was disabled in its entirety on the fight. I could draw many more similar examples-Malenia and Mantis lords(both fast paced and very punishing fights) for example. And don't even get me started on the quests here. They are so horrible they dont deserve to be spoken of. Basically the main issue is how unbalanced boss battles are(took the challenging for the sake of challenging path instead of challenging for the sake of rewarding path)

Its a shame. Literally everything other than the things I talked of has been done perfectly.
Also, if anyone thinks I should just ""get gud"", I have 112% in hollow knight and 100% in Celeste and has beaten a countless amount of undertale fangames(which have quite an infamy for their difficulty), I do know quite a bit in terms of fun challenges.";62.6;0.0;2.0;25.0;Posted: May 16

Since there's no neutral option I'm going with neg to point out some of the games flaws. Some of what I say may have spoilers, but I'll try not to add any. Overall I enjoy the game and will continue to play it off and on, but this is definitely the weakest souls game From Software has made in my opinion.

The game is well made, it's solid, but it's the jankiest of any FS souls game I've played, has multiple glitches, and the open world mechanics clash and weaken what I personally like about the souls games, like a sense of achievement or reward. I went through my first time cold, then my second time with a guide to comb through. I've been through a third since then, and I've tried out about 2 builds per char.

-Tons of glitches and crashes, on PC at least. Summoning errors that have not been corrected since launch that only seem to effect a certain group of people (https://tinyurl.com/42rhh6nt) Body/rune recovery glitches, broken quests (still) inaccurate stat scaling on multiple accounts (some fixed) Getting attacked through walls is way worse than it's ever been before - enemies and bosses read inputs as a cheap mechanism to kill you.

-Overall I died more in this game to being overrun with surprise enemies than in any other souls game - being jumped and surrounded and stun locked seems to be the main thing in this game. As long as you are patient and use target lock there's not much of a challenge outside of a boss room or two.

-as for BOSSES - so many are reused it's sad. some of the main bosses are re-used over and over again in the open world dungeons, which are quite often the same layout, and just feel like weak busy work and excuses to kill time. Most can be completed in less than 10 minutes. a couple few may give you a challenge and last 30.

-about QUESTS, that obscure souls quest system was fun and great in the more funneled design of the previous souls games. Having NPCS randomly move around such a large open world makes some quests impossible to understand without a guide.

-While a a previous Dark Souls game may offer you multiple paths to take, you'd always inevitably hit a boss you need to handle, sometimes leaving you stuck between a rock and a hard place until you figured it out. The sense of accomplishment from this situation is gone, since now you can run around the open world and level and gear to your hearts content. Without killing the first MINI boss, you can comb every single area of the game minus a small handful of end game areas, which only require 2 boss kills. The result is a lot of well geared invaders at lower levels stomping people. There's also no level cap on weapon buffs like the old games, so a level 5 char can rock an end game +25 sword and invade your beginning char. This could happen in previous souls games, but it took skill to pass the boss gates at the low levels to get that gear to invade. Not anymore.

-The lack of design in the open world can be plainly seen, and is mostly there as a huge time waster. There's not much reason to the day/night cycle besides some hidden bosses and some enemies may drop a small amount more of runes. The stealth mechanics are laughably OP and the AI is totally blind making free stealth damage a constant no matter what your build. A lot off items I'd usually just be able to buy from a vendor over and over with souls/runes are now replaced with crafting system crap I need to waste time to farm up instead. If you get invaded in the open world might as well just sit and wait for 5 minutes for the idiot to come running towards you lol. Just a lot of weakness in what I was expecting to be tighter gameplay.

Overall this game is the worst where it strays from it's traditional design, the open world is weak, almost everything about it is a boring addition, or weakens the strength of the souls formula, I think it's a good first attempt, but my hope in the future is they do more legacy type areas and far less open world areas, the lack of having a funneled design in a lot of the open worlds places makes it weak, exploitable, and overall less enjoyable.";243.0;0.0;2.0;313.0;Posted: May 22

Probably a lot of fun for people who don't have to work for a living. I have always avoided Dark souls games and Dark souls like games because i knew it wasn't my thing. Unfortunately, I heard and read all of the great reviews and since I'm out of other great games to play I purchased this one. Buyers remorse.

If you don't have enough stress in your life and need something that makes you want to kick puppies, if hours worth of pissing contests is your cup of tea, if you tend to only enjoy the combat in games, this is the game for you!
If however, you are the type of person who plays games to wind down or have fun, I'd suggest you pass.

Elden ring is like going through a maze with a blind fold on while people hit you in the face with baseball bats. The little bit of story there is in the game tends to have many steps to it and very little of it has any guidance, expect extensive use of Google. If the game actually tried to have a meaningful story, other than a general idea of one, it could have been enjoyable enough to justify the purchase for me but as it stands it was a waste.

The good:
- Graphics are about average for current games (character creation is an exception).
- Combat, while most often frustrating can be fun sometimes.
- The builds and leveling seem rewarding and can be interesting.
- Finding something interesting or a secret area can often be an enjoyable experience.
- Mods made the game playable for me. I shouldn't have to mod a game to make it enjoyable, at least it's not terribly difficult to do.

The bad:
- The characters you meet in the game are mostly shallow, not well written or have any real effort put into them. After 70 hours of play, I haven't found any character I care about or care what they have to say.
- Very little direction as to where to go and what to do, some see this as a positive but I don't because the only way to find out your in the wrong place is to get your face beat in and keep getting your face beat in until you find a place where you don't get smashed(or google it). Wander aimlessly around until you find something interesting and repeat that until you can get through one of the areas where you previously got your face beat in.
- Character creation is clunky and out dated. Women don't really look like women, they look like ugly men with boobs. It feels like the designers forgot to have women in the game and added the option last minute?
- Can't figure out where to go to get that thing you need to progress to the next area? Google. Can't figure out where to find that weapon or armor you need? Google. Google. Google..... Annoying.
- Experience points and money are the same thing. Interesting idea except that you can lose it all when you die. Losing hours worth of experience when you are unable to get to the same place you died isn't fun. While it's not a big deal early game, late game when you are talking about millions of experience is a big deal and not fun.
- Online play. While Co-op could be fun the rest is really stupid and pointless. Invasions are for those who really enjoy the pissing contest aspect of the game, really not my thing, I'm not 12. The notes players can leave for other players could be interesting and worth while if the people who were leaving notes weren't 12 and obsessed with genitalia and butts. The blood stains allowing you to see how other people died is rarely ever useful either as it's mostly just people jumping off cliffs or doing something similarly stupid. The ghosts of other players and the path they take is also interesting but again poorly executed as they look a lot like the ghost mobs so they can cause frustrating deaths when you mistake a player's ghost for a mob while you are in a dark cave where you can't really tell what is going on in the first place.";69.9;0.0;4.0;65.0;Posted: May 20

After ungodly amounts of hours in Souls games, I've come to realize I don't quite enjoy playing these sorts of games anymore, and Elden Ring only exacerbates everything that turned me away from the series in the first place. Is it the sacred cows that pervades throughout all the games? Perhaps it's the pastiche of poorly realized action and RPG mechanics that only seem to blend together because the systems lack any sort of depth in the first place. Or just maybe, it's because it revels in this sort of mean-spirited, emotionally manipulative design, tacitly inserting brain worms telling you the dopamine pay-off of playing a ""hard game"" more than makes up for the impotent rage it'll definitely put you through, no matter how terrible, or lazy, or unfair, or God forbid unfun the challenges you'll face ahead are.

Why should I even care about fighting the screetards (See: Royal Revenants), or the Runebears that are more vicious and more durable than 90% of the game's bosses, or the late game enemies which are actually mobs recycled from early game content and refurbished with just enough stat bloat to 3-4 shot (in some cases 1-2) an appropriately leveled Tarnished, all of which exist solely to make a mockery of my Demigod slayer's amazing feats that would pit him in the annals as an incredible hero of legends? My character never feels stronger, or more competent at any point, the only thing that improves is my skill as a player. Now this would normally be fine, if I wasn't granted the delusion of playing a ROLE-PLAYING GAME, and it would be fine if for all the loot and skills I acquire I was granted some kind of meaningful sense of progression so I'm better suited to deal with the stronger foes of Elden Ring, but it never comes. From level 8 to 150 or so, I'm equally equipped to deal with Revenants. If this game is a ""true RPG"", then so is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Actually I take it back, even SotN has a more satisfying progression curve than ER.

Do I even need to go into the horrendous boss design of this game either? It's garbage, not just the bosses themselves (most of them do suck however), but the combat and movement itself leaves so much to be desired, tying into the original point about underutilized RPG and action mechanics I brought up earlier. These are the devs that made Bloodborne and Sekiro and we're STILL relying on roll-based movement in this high fantasy epic? What's even the point of the backstep? The new jump mechanic isn't innovation, it's a basic feature for any game that doesn't take pride in being ""antiquated"" in its design philosophy like the Souls series does. Seriously, am I the only one who thinks it's absurd you're rolling around in heavy armor just as much as a cloth-garbed Wizard would?

You know what else? I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about Elden Ring's World, I don't care about the characters, the grand choices that'll define the shape of The Lands Between itself, the DEEP LORE!!! either, it's all just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dark Souls. Same old Dark Souls and it's gloomy nihilistic themes of ""regeneration and degeneration uoOOoooH"", this time with a corprophiliac fantasy writer from New Jersey on board. It's all so banal. That's the real problem of this game, it brings nothing new to the table. It's pure kitsch, even the reviews reflect this; emphasis on ""hard satisfying gameplay that doesn't hold the player's hand"" or ""an open world without quest markers blaring in your face"", all of which says little about the quality of the game itself.

The game is a miserable skinner box, and I'll only complete it out of an obligation to a friend, but I can't be assed right now. Also PvP shouldn't exist in this game.";241.8;0.0;9.0;154.0;Posted: May 19

Felt shallow and lazy compared to previous games, and the news systems detract from the game more than add. Most ash of wars are just plain inferior to anything else you can choose in almost every circumstance available to the point where over half are completely worthless to everyone at all times. They buffed and expanded bleeding to the point where its all that is used in pvp and just silently slid magic in all forms into the trashcan. Bows and crossbows still exist but both types are completely worthless past the very start of the game, and then we get into the dozens of bosses that are exactly the same as the previous one but with a different skin and a new attack or two. This isn't just bosses though, elden ring re uses regular enemies too such a degree that there is hardly more than 5 types in the entire game that can be compared to their almost the same cousins. Its also open world... except its not really, too get any sort of even partial completion of any npc questline or even access to the basic systems of the game you either have too look it up, get lucky, or just accept that you will have nothing but bad endings and halfways done npc storylines. A clothing system exists that hardly does anything at all, the summon and horse system are solo only and completely unavailable in multiplayer. This game pretty much tops being the worst in the history of its genre because its made by a big company and has good graphics... because thats all it has, the recognition of being made by a big company and shiny colors, thats it. How this game wasn't completely destroyed by the entire fanbase for its complete and utter lack of uniqueness and follow through I will never know.";139.8;0.0;3.0;252.0;Posted: May 23

Game is a slog after the capital area. Stoped having fun fighting hard bosses and would require you to make a stupidly overpowered build (with cheese) rather than actually beating bosses with the skills you've gained. Also, despite the amount of veriety in the game, you end up getting shoehorned into a build from the begiening of the game based on the weapons you've leveled up. i decided to level up the Golden Halberd and I had to constantly respec my character because I would want to try a new weapon but couldent because you wouldent know if the weapon was good or not until youve wasted all your smithing stones on the weapon. this game requires you to do reserch online to find out what build is actually good which is fine if you like min-maxing your character but terrible if you actually want to have fun playing the game. The best parts of the game are the exploration but even then there are point in the game which actively discourage you from exploring. Theres even a section of the map near the Liurnia Erdetree that DOES NOT MATCH THE terrain. I really do wish the later portions of the game were as enjoyable as the earlier parts but with all of these problems, ON TOP OF the already shoddy performance of the game on PC (i have a 3070 the game should run fine but doesnt), i cant recomend this game to anyone at it's current state. The only reason Ive decided not to continue playing and to post this reveiw is because the game constatly crashes durring the Fire Giant cutscene making progress in the game impossible, otherwise i would just be sulking to myself about how this game could be better.";64.4;0.0;2.0;58.0;Posted: May 21

So this is a full priced AAA 2022 game which has:

* PC controls which would not be considered acceptable even in the 1980s. (Even though you can rebind the keys, this game was designed exclusively for a PS controller, not a mouse/keyboard - so for instance, the F key by default jumps - because that's how insane the PC controls are.)

* UI design which would also not be considered be acceptable even in the 1990s

* Loading screen which shows a message box you have to click ""Accept"" on every time you go to the main menu. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

* Graphics which would be considered cutting edge back in 2006.

* A story, but not one which you can actually follow. I finished it and as far as I can tell there's a ring (maybe? it's in the title of the game - but never seen it) and eventually <spoiler>you kill the ruler/god of the land and I guess that means you're in charge?</spoiler> I don't think I finished a single NPC's questline - and there were about 50 of them. I mean you could if you really, really wanted, but you'd have to Google how to do it and then follow the instructions exactly - if you deviate, the questline just ends - with no notification whatsoever. While there is a map (thank god - the world is huge), only < 1% of the questlines actually put locations that you're supposed to go to on this map - to the extent that if you see a location marked on your map - you think it's a bug.

* Intentionally annoying level design - which just consumes your time - but neither adds difficulty nor is fun. (You will die 500ish times in the course of playing this game - and each time, you'll burn about 10s on a loading screen, and then 20s-120s just running back to start the boss fight again). So that's about 20h of your life wasted.

There is an intended delay input that ruins your roll timing. Can't enjoy this game because of it. Go back and play Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro and see if you feel as much delay as Elden Ring have. FromSoftware wants to the make the game artificially hard but does this instead of making well designed difficult bosses like Slave Knight Gael. And no there is no controller delay input or pressed but not let go because there is no controller at all. Ive been playing with keyboard only from Dark Souls 1, quick tap space every time to roll. And my PC specs are RTX 3060 TI, Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB RAM. So my PC isn't giving me delay, neither are my keyboard. I am done with this game because of it, I refuse to play a scared ranged magic build running around and gunning every boss down like the rest of these players. I want to run in there with no shield but a sword and roll dodge everything, and while i've learned the patterns, i simply can't react in time because the delay input is too long. Why do you have the boss attack so bloody fast when you implement a roll input delay? It just doesn't make any sense. Fix this and ill overlook the terrible open world, terrible difficulty balance, the endless repetition of the bosses, the overkill moveset the bosses throw at you, the lame NPCs storyline, the non-existent maiden, the lame story, and the fact that it is not even close to how amazing Dark Souls 3 boss designs were. I mean at this point I rather fight Gael than all of the bosses combined in Elden Ring.";71.1;0.0;1.0;31.0;Posted: May 21

This game would be great IF IT DIDN'T CRASH EVERY TIME I OPEN THE GAME. Fix this buggy crap, I've spent more time trying to make it work than actually playing it. It's like the devs didn't make any attempt to make it playable. It should never have been released on PC in this condition. I've been playing the game 30 seconds at a time. Never had to close it myself, FromSoft does that for me and then has the balls to tell me ""make sure to close it properly"". What a trash port, wasted my damn money.

Update after a bit more time trying to fix the game: ITS STILL BROKE AS ♥♥♥♥. Steam Cloud Saves keeps re-enabling itself which I think may be causing crashes (on top of also potentially deleting saves, thanks valve). No matter what I do cloud saving turns itself back on. The game still crashes upon loading into the world. The only way to play is to open it like 30 damn times and just hope it doesn't crash. I have still never had the pleasure of pressing exit game myself. I play till it crashes, then open it 30 more times. ♥♥♥♥ you FromSoft and ♥♥♥♥ you Valve.";24.8;0.0;0.0;187.0;Posted: May 20

Fits into the category of 'best game that cannot be played'. From save game crashes (bye bye 150 hour 1st play through), to stuttering on the lowest settings I can choose (laptop has RTX 2060). An incredible game, that cannot be played properly. As some reviewers have already said, don't buy on PC, buy on console(and that pains me no end).";166.5;0.0;1.0;54.0;Posted: May 22

i don't get why this is such a popular game. given i haven't played the previous installments or put a lot of hours into elden ring, it really hasn't been been able to capture me with either story or game play. the world and bosses are beautiful, yet to me so far feels empty. maybe my mind will change if i put more than a 27 hours into playing but at this point i shouldn't feel like its almost a chore to pick up.";27.4;0.0;0.0;27.0;Posted: May 21

I just can't, even as an admirer of the Dark Souls games and Sekiro, give this game a good rating.
Reason number 1 by far: There are so many bosses and mini bosses that are the same or just randomly put together in different combinations over and over and over again. It is boring and I am sick and tired of it. The general vibe of wanting to beat a boss and progress is just done for me in this game.
Number 2: The world gets emptier and emptier the further you progress. It's boring.
Number 3: The clipping issues on some armor are ridiculous for a 2022 game. Bull-Goat set for example is the biggest cancer I've ever seen in any game. And why does heavy armor always need to look as stupid in any FromSoft game anyway?
Number 4: Multiplayer balancing needs serious rework done.

Maybe some DLCs will bring change but I am not to hopeful.";159.7;0.0;3.0;86.0;Posted: May 20

I'm only commenting on immediately noticeable technical issues related to the game and not the game play itself

Issues:

(1) 60 FPS lock on a 2022 PC

- If you have a display that can refresh the screen faster than 60 Hz, then 60 FPS lock is pants on PC because you get screen tearing that you won't get if the game is allowed to push more than 60 FPS

(2) This game is not optimized for PC. All of in-game button popups are for XBOX controllers. I have to sit there and figure out what the keyboard equivalent to 'Y', 'A', 'B', etc., are";0.7;0.0;0.0;41.0;Posted: May 21

Steam does not give me a choice ""May be"", selected ""No"". please have some time going through the comment before making a decision.

First time player for the Soul's series - 100% recommended game.
----------------------

Player's familiar with Soul's series - I have a mixed feeling. i would not recommend the game 100 %, at least at the current sate.
Elden ring is just dark souls 3.5 with some added mechanic's like Jump, horse, Crafting, Ashes of War, added new flask system, stealth...
Approx it would take 65 - 80 hours to complete the game for the first time. it took me around approx 122 hours for my first play through

The first 35 - 40 hours, of the game you will certainly get a feel like ""this is how a open world should be made"".
Next 10 - 20 hours, ""hey i saw this guy/place some were else... its ok after all its a huge game""
After 60 hours, Fromsoftware really .. this guy for 13th time .. Copy paste *** sh** ...

fromsoftware always encouraged exploration, but Elden ring does not seems to embrace it. i may be wrong but it feels like the game was rushed. the last 30 hours or last half of the game you would feel like you experienced everything the game has to offer.
Later part of the map seems to be like a drag , a marketing stunt to show how big Elden ring is rather than user experiance.
i am not sure may be they might be adding content.

PVP - Connection error, unable to summon, Blue Katana, Red Katana, Bleed, crouch poke, spam spells, bloodhound step, un-scaled phantom, AFK farmers, glitches, ""No skill required - press L2 to win"".
fun fact, you can buy any of the in game item via black market web site .. no skill required.

Lore - 50 shades of Maiden less guys/girl .. no may be ""Queen Marika the Eternal"" i don't know.. till now.. i had a understanding that all the core fromsoftware game will have a full story associated with the main game, DLC would mostly be stand alone but as experiencing Elden ring i feel story is half baked and relay heavy on DLC.

Bosses - Hey i am a Souls player, wait and punish... find a opening, i have to learn his pattern.i just have to role for iframes...
Boss starts a comboooooooo .. still comboo is going oooon... after 30 minutes .. souls player 'does this guy ever stop.. may be i am playing wrong .. souls player ""ha finally opening"" ... Boss ""lol, animation cancel.. one shot combooooo"". souls player - screw this rot breath, Rivers of blood'.

Elden ring iconic boss ""who never knew defeat""- Infinite regeneration, has ability to travel from Earth to Moon to finish a move, input reading, unlimited Combo, unlimited poise (cannot be interrupted during a move). fromsoftware even had to make her nude to sell the game.

--------------
i also strongly recommend, not going for a Bleed or Arcane build for the first playthrough. since its not balanced its too powerfull that i don't even know the moveset for bosess in first 3 dungeons. i had to respec to have some challenge / fun.

Overall, i am not saying the game is bad.. its a really good game when compared to other open world title but not a master piece. the game has so much potential ..
you have to look at the review by a person who was inspired by fromsoftware previous work and disappointed with Elden ring.";302.1;0.0;0.0;83.0;Posted: May 19

First of I want to say that I've played tons of souls and souls-like games. With that in mind, I'm extremely divided with my experience with this game and here's why.

I'll start off with the positives; the first third or half if we're being generous are downright magical, especially the first 20-30 hours or so. For me, time flew by, I stayed up all night exploring, killing tough bosses, finding out all sorts of great secrets and just had myself a blast. Open world and Dark Souls works surprisingly well...or so I thought, but more on that later.

The overall atmosphere of the game is also great and it looks gorgeous. Visuals have always been one of the better selling points of Souls-games in my opinion and they nailed that once again. Many areas in the game are as fun to look at as they are to explore and they were for the most part fairly creative with them. Exploring them is also pretty fun, although that again diminishes over time in my opinion; last third being exceptionally boring if you ask me.

One double-edged sword for me is the variety given to player to tackle the many enemies that the Lands Between throws at you. While variety is the spice of life and I'm a big spicy food enthusiast, I think this time it might have gone a bit too far. I'm the completionist type who likes to explore everything, which I did during my playthrough of the game; I explored every area, every dungeon, beat every boss, got every possible rune to get whatever ending I desired. The issue is that many of the items you get, you will just not use, which diminishes the eagerness to explore. Spells are good example of this; there are dozens of them in the game, but if you're playing a melee build, which is the most common way to play these games, you will most likely not use them all that much, or mostly a selected handful that boost your combat effectiveness. Still, I enjoyed the exploring overall, but this aspect of it did suffer as a result.

Many weapons you get might be hard to upgrade with lacking materials, so once you find what works for you, you're not likely to change, unless to have a backup weapon or two in case you want something specific, like bleed damage for example. Never before has there been an option to get so over-powered so easily, which I feel takes much charm out of the experience.

The last third of the game for me was a slog, with any battle be it just normal foe or boss being challenging in a fun way; most of them I could beat after few tries, some of which I didn't even get to hear all of the dialogue. The element of summon spirits is also fuels this much more. Code Vein, also Souls-like game, also had co-op character as integral part of it's design and in that game the difficulty of it was still well maintained. Sadly, I can't say the same for Elden Ring. One spirit summon in particular is notorious and most people who have beaten the game know what I'm talking about. Some people would say that you don't have to use it, which is true, but summon spirits are a game mechanic the game very heavily promotes, be it through upgrades, sheer amount of them you can get and how many of the bosses are seemingly made with one (or more) additional character on your side. Them taking the attention away from you, taking away the one versus one nail biting gameplay the series is known for to me is maybe the single biggest miss with this game. This is the most accessible game From Software has ever done, but I think it has come at too big of a cost. Much like horror movies, to me difficulty of the experience is just part of it's foundation; by default, some people aren't going to like it, and that's okay. With them trying to please everyone, ultimately it feels like the opposite of desired effect was reached, unless the player handicaps themselves.

Outside of the issues with the bosses and their design, the second biggest flaw that really hindered my enjoyment of the game is oddly enough the open world nature of the game. Since the player is fairly free to explore the areas in whatever order they desire, it is fairly easy to end up being too low level for a certain area and being too high level for another. Since Souls-games don't exactly show you what level you ought to be for any area (which I think is good, mind you, we don't need these games to be Ubisoft clones), it made some areas extremely boring.

In my playthrough, I visited the Raya Lucaria Academy fairly late, after I had beaten Volcano Manor. Volcano Manor was maybe the single best experience to me in the game; the entire area oozed with atmosphere, was challenging, with memorable characters, enemies and bosses. Were everything about the game to this level, I would have given this game two thumbs up for sure. When I entered Raya Lucaria Academy afterwards, it was absolute cakewalk. During my run, I think I died maybe two or three times and that was mostly due to falling, not because of enemies. I'm also by no means the most amazing gamer out there, despite being Souls veteran, but I was simply way too high of a level to the area. I really wish there was some sort of scaling option in the game to keep the areas challenging, but without it the enjoyment for me was ruined almost completely when I never had to learn the boss moves and patterns, as simply going to their face and smacking them did the trick.

I also think that the game is too big for it's own good. To me this is maybe heightened the most by the absolutely insane amount of bosses being recycled in the game. There are total of 9 truly unique boss fights in the game, with everything else being copies of at least one another boss one way or another. Some bosses you will see so many times that they lose all of their magic, like dragons or magma wyrms for example; both fights that were initially extremely fun, challenging and memorable, but by 5th time you can't help but to your roll your eyes. I would have much preferred if they had cut out chunks of the game, like the snowy area towards the end to make the rest of the experience tighter, more narrowed, focused and unique.

I quickly also want to mention riding and crafting. I was fairly neutral on both of these personally. I didn't use crafting all that much, with exception of ailment items and pots for the most part. There were tons and tons of recipes, but more often than not there was no need for them, at least not for me personally. This is maybe because gathering resources was tedious when you're not riding past a field of them or when exploring a cave. Not a bad concept, but I still felt like it wasn't utilized properly either, but certainly didn't ruin the game for me either.

As for riding, I quite enjoyed the horse combat. I liked it when especially when fighting the dragons as you could dodge the breath attacks and quickly catch up with them. Overall though I feel like this system too was a bit underutilized. This might be a personal taste thing, but to me Souls games are still better without it. Again, a hit and miss feature in my eyes.

Overall, this is the first Souls game I struggled having to finish. The highs of the game are very much up there, the first third or half of the game is truly a magical experience, definitely worth both the time and money I put into it. As the game progresses, however, the magic fades away and you're left with big, yet empty feeling world. The numerous issues that seem to go up against the very core design the series is both know and loved for makes this a bitter soup to swallow. I can't say that I hated my time with the game, but I can't say that I wholeheartedly enjoyed it either. I hope that despite the insane success of this title that From Software takes few steps back to inspect their work before starting the next project. If their next game repeats most of the things that were in the Elden Ring, it might be my very first purposeful pass for the series. And as someone who really loves these games, I hope that won't be the case.";135.9;0.0;3.0;596.0;Posted: May 21

Pros:
The combat is great and so are the larger dungeons.

Cons:
Same copy paste catacombs, enemies, ruins and caves. It would've taken a massive effort and budget for FromSoftware to make unique elements in every region so they settled for repetition.

Not a very good game, lots of BS mechanics that are just left in because its supposed to be a difficult game.

this game has to be one of the most unfun fromsoftware games i have ever played, and i have played them all. for the first 5 or so hours the game is fine, just your run of the mill souls game. new bosses around every corner, a since of wonder as you enter a new cave or catacomb. but after limgrave everything just gets dull, reused bosses, boring areas, and empty open world makes this game lose its luster after a while.

and not im going to talk about my biggest problems with this game, the horrendus boss design. first i will talk about the bosses, 90% of the bosses in this game are reused.. from seems to think ""putting two bosses together in a tiny room will make this boss good"" but its just not fun. walking into a room after walking through a reused dungeon just to see a reused boss, or god forbid two reused bosses in the same room get old after the second time. and they didnt even think about balancing the bosses that you run into, like the godskin duo. two bosses that are super fast, deal too much damage, and can read your imputs does not make a fun boss, it makes a boss that makes you regret buying this game.";1.0;0.0;2.0;54.0;Posted: May 16

I tried giving this game a good review, but it simply is not fun if you ever try to summon any friends. You get invaded every 3 minutes by people with higher levels. They are always fully equipped, they are always overlevelled, and their main move is rolling. When in doubt, roll it till you make it. It's an atrocity. I've played the original Demon's Souls on PS3 where invasions added a touch of danger to the game, but this is just stupid. The developers put no thought into this at all.

Nowadays there is too many players active, and you simply can't enjoy yourself. The invasions don't add anything to the experience if they are so methodical. It's just repetitive annoyance. The only players here having fun are the invaders, everybody else be damned.

I've been trying to play the same strip of 15 meters with my friend for weeks. It's impossible, you simply can't. You get invaded over and over and over and over. 90% of the time by the same person with no life at all, who sit there and only invade.

Repetitive nonsense.

Edit: We do manage to kill the invader sometimes, but seems like we get a 10 minute grace period after which the invasions just keep on coming again. A grace period of 35 minutes or at least banning the same person from re-invading for a while would have helped. Instead you get the same invader often 3-4 times. Even if you defeat them, they just keep coming back.";61.1;0.0;3.0;366.0;Posted: May 21

IF you like playing with Mouse and Keyboard, this game is not for you

This game is clearly designed with an X-Box type controller in mind. Even choosing my character type was frustrating as there was no indication what keyboard or mouse key I should press. The game ran smooth and the graphics looked beautiful, but having grown up playing WOW and similar games on PC, not in the mood to have to be forced to use a controller. Sure you can bind all the button you wish you your keyboard, but then the tutorials keep saying press the Y button to read, A button etc... I refunded it. Hopefully they can optimize this in the future and I will check it out again.";0.6;0.0;0.0;293.0;Posted: May 23

NOPE! WAY TOO MUCH FLAMBOYANT BS

Yea its pretty. Semi-decent combat. BUT, this game has dropped the ball and catered to a very niche market of players that spend their life playing hard AF games I guess. Its just total bulltish when a boss changes direction mid jump in the air, defying all physics, and one shots you. That's fair, yeppers. Great game guys. 🤔 If I could get my money back I would.

I've played and beaten all the Dark Souls games and Bloodborne, but I had a bad feeling about this game since I played the beta in November. It's a mediocre RPG, if you want to call it that. The exploration is bland (it was fun at first but became increasingly more of a chore). Strange - most games simply cannot nail exploration, yet it's a bit of surprise this one couldn't. The combat is pretty good - significantly better than DS3, although not as good as DS2 or 1. The graphics are far too green, and they do this trick wherein some places look extremely nice, like Stormveil, but other places look like trash. I've noticed that some games do this and it's a little confusing on the eyes. Like in some areas Fallout 4 looked excellent, and in others it looked like mud. The quests are dull and mysterious to the point in which they become uninteresting. One problem that I really have with the game as well is that for a large number of the items you need to do research on how exactly to get them. In DS2 I randomly came upon Havel's armor and used it for the rest of the game, along with the Mammoth sword. No research necessary. Elden Ring isn't trash, although it is a disappointment. I'd say DS2 is best (lol unpopular view), then DS1, Bloodborne, Elden Ring, and then DS3.";64.0;0.0;1.0;43.0;Posted: May 21

It’s no secret that Elden Ring has gained A LOT of praise. Besides the buggy launch with performance issues (welcome to the gaming industry for the last 15 years), most people have only great things to say about it. I’m more in the mixed camp.

For the first time in the Souls series from Software, it’s fun to use mage build. It’s VERY flexible and you have so many spells (if you can find them) to play around with. The Spirits is also a good addition if you lack co-op help.

Now, while I do enjoy most of the game I also have gripes with it. But none of it makes it a silly super low score.

The technical stuff:

The Easy Anti Cheat is really pointless and network stability when doing invading or co-op is unstable. Somehow this has gotten worse since Dark Souls 3. Which is weird. I do hope FromSoftware does a better job on online play in the future because it REALLY needs work. Framerate is still unstable and I’m sure if it’s the old game engine or the damn awful AC implementation used.

Gameplay and map:

I know OPEN WORLD is very popular. Sadly Elden Ring’s map feels more like something from a Ubisoft game. By the end, you have so many icons on the map that it’s ridiculous. Also, the many mini-dungeons are really BORING. I know the previous games had smaller environments because of the consoles. But it also just worked pretty well for the games. Everything felt connected. I don’t feel that with Elden Ring.

- The lock-on system is still awful and they REALLY need to update it with their next game as well.
- Controls are clunky.
- Way too many useless spirits.
- Unless you are hardcore and have A LOT of time, good luck finding and understanding most things in the game without online guides. Some of these quests are old-school Nintendo Castlevania ♥♥♥♥ and not that interesting. Of course, this is not new to the Souls series.

For me the game is a 3/5 Stars
It’s not bad and there is fun to be had. No doubt. For me it’s just a mixed bag. + not greedy tactics from the publisher is good. But for me games like Bloodborne (PS4 only sadly) and Dark Souls 3 is still their best games to date.";122.6;0.0;0.0;258.0;Posted: May 21

The more I started playing this game serious, the more it became clear that these developers have NO FFIN CLUE WHAT THE F THEY'RE DOING.

The game is just copy/pasted code from their previous games, held together by ductape.

The playerbase might as well have never existed on PC. Server connection and packet consistence is pathetic for a paid game. It will take you 20 attempts to invade anyone, and you can expect to disconnect when you're summoned. Successful connections are typically AFK farmers and 3v1 campers with cheese builds because I guess, you know, the only people playing this bunghole of a deserted game on PC are snot eating 12 year olds. The bosses are extremely fun and so is the theorycrafting, and you will be left to find the game has zero replayability, NG+ is also easier than the first run. Way to go FromSoft.

Graphics: 9/10
Story: 5/10
Gameplay: 4/10 (Could be 8/10 if they fixed the bugs)


Game is fun on the surface but it gets worse the more you play it. The combat system would be great if it weren't for the numerous bugs. This game is full of bugs and bs mechanics. The camera is purposefully designed to make you unable to see where you wanna see during fights and it clips into walls every single time you get close to one. When horse riding you have to constantly fight the camera from recentering, preventing you from looking around. The dodge and parry mechanics are broken as hell, you do the same thing twice but get different results every single time. If you like open worlds, you will most likely enjoy this game but as for me, I hate having no specific path, I feel like I'm always either missing out on content or wasting hours to get to said content. As far as the story goes, it's sub-par. Just sparse NPCs hinting at things but never actually telling you much. At least the fast travel system is pretty good and it doesn't have any type of microtransaction though, which is greatly welcomed in 2022.

On top of that, this game feels like it was poorly ported to pc: no ultrawide support, 60fps lock, menu/UI for MnK feels unresponsive. Multiplayer feels like an afterthought, it's such a hassle. I feel like this game only received the praise it's had because the gaming industry has set the bar so low lately that most people are willing to accept mostly anything. The game is worth playing but I cannot get excited to play it, it feels too repetitive and full of ♥♥♥♥. I would only recommend this game to people who are either hardcore Soulsborne games or to those who are desperate to play something new, though I would wait for a sale if you can.";26.3;0.0;0.0;32.0;Posted: May 23

I love this game a ton and I've barely poured any time into it. Its the first from software game i wanted to play but oh my dear sweet god is that multiplayer busted into oblivion. From Software thought that instead of making enemies tougher in coop, they'd rather offer rewards to players for being douche bags and killing people. Because all you're doing is enticing people to ruin others' fun for no reason. If this is absolutely necessary then make a mode for people who like getting invaded and see how many people play it. People enjoy these games for the challenge but i think most of us can agree the invasion system should be able to be toggled on and off. This game is fantastic but please my friend and I will be having a blast with the challenge and the adventure then we get invaded by some meta weeaboo and just like that we both are miserable and quit out of the game as it ruins all the fun. If the invasion system is loved by the audience then see whos still using the system if you make it toggleable.

What could have been a truly amazing co-op experience is unfortunately hindered by one of the worst co-op multiplayer systems implemented in a game to date. Progress is not saved for both players, meaning you have to run all bosses and objectives twice. The player being summoned will also be de-summoned after every single boss event and/or after either of the two players die. This means that throughout even a short play session you'll have to spend tons of time just re-summoning your friend, over and over and over, ad nauseam. It doesn't add anything meaningful to the gameplay cycle, and I struggle to see why they chose this system over literally any other more viable option. Finally, you'll spend lots of time struggling against invading PvP players (that you cannot disable). Now, I don't mind PvP in games (although I would of course prefer to at least have the option to choose), but when the vast majority of encounters are with players using either cheats to win or to brick your game (yes, that's a thing, they can ruin your save file by using altered items), then the whole gameplay experience takes a hard turn for the worse.";91.2;0.0;2.0;298.0;Posted: May 22

TLDR: Search on youtube ""let me solo her Malena"". That's the game in a nut shell. If you like what you see then you will enjoy this game (controller is a must however).

Kind of a 3D Mortal Combat arcade fighting game (extensive twitch muscle memory when mashing buttons is a must) with very light RPG elements and lots of exploration (this is were the Asian culture of the developer comes out) though very much of it is repetitive. It's essentially a console game that works quite poorly on PC (don't even attempt using a keyboard and mouse - as a matter of fact the game's input tool-tips by default assume you are using a controller).

The combat has a bunch of contrived mechanics slapped together that are probably in place to account for the limitations of a console controller (can't control vision and also hit XYBA buttons at the same time - I am using a steam controller - etc.). As a side note, I don't play console games because I find the controllers subpar compared to a keyboard and mouse.

Veterans of PC FPS games are REALLY going to struggle with the camera movement, the controls and the combat mechanics. Be prepared to forget everything you know and learn something you will only use in the ""FromSoft"" games. There's nothing else quite like it on the PC market and that's probably for a very good reason.
You got stuff like rolling (dodging) into mob abilities and take no damage as long as you do it at the right time (they call this immunity frames), you can jump to avoid some ground aoe (even though the particle effects clearly engulf you visually) and so on. In addition there's some very sadistic input requirements some are just stupid some are likely driven by the use of the controller. For example to dodge in a specific direction you have to hold down the direction button for at least a second BEFORE pressing the dodge button, and to run you have to press and hold the dodge button for at least a second - all this in a game were dodging/sprinting in the right direction at the right millisecond is vital. I thought maybe they are trying to simulate inertia and mass, but that's not the case as you (and mobs) can do a 180 turn on a pin head when rolling or running when using the mouse.
And then there is dodging. Lots of It as Boss combos can be very long (6-7 moves or more). This game should really be called Elden Dodge. Yes there's stuff like parry and blocking but their usage is extremely limited when fighting a boss (again mainly because of the length of the combos). A boss fight consists of 3-4, up to 8 or even more consecutive very well timed dodges followed by one swing. Rinse and repeat until boss is dead.

Regarding RPG, there is essentially no character customization in terms of stats. As a matter of fact it really doesn't matter what class you start with as they will end up identical if/when you max all their stats. Spells, weapons and armor cannot be customized in any way (you do have 5-6 types of arrow damage and more arrows that do same type of damage just more of it). Weapons can be upgraded (it's a straight forward damage buff) and can be tweaked with abilities (called ashes of war). There are lots of weapons but for the most part only a handful of classes (15 weapon classes or so?). The class gives the weapon it's move set (what it does when you swing it). Each weapon can have up to 1 ability. Most do come with one. An ash of war allows you to change that one ability and also change the damage type (and the stat with which the damage scales, but it's not really important).

Quests are limited (this is no way an Elder Scrolls Game). The story and characters are very Asian. The lore is definitely something to behold as GRR Martin (he got hired for this game) is a master lore builder, but a complete failure when it comes to story telling (that's why he keeps killing all his characters in his books, because he can't tell a story to save his life and he needs to make room for new characters and the lore surrounding them).

There is a lot of fake hype surrounding this game. Going in I heard stuff like ""best mounted combat in any game ever"" etc. Don't be mistaken, this game's combat mechanics cannot begin to compare with stuff you find in titles like ""For Honor"" or ""Mount & Blade"". And what it has is weird, contrived, awkward, going into a direction all of its own. And just another example of how awful and contrived the controls of this game are (again probably driven by the fact that the input scheme is designed for a console controller): You cannot turn your mount around AND stand put in a given spot (say atop a cliff). Not with your normal controls. You CAN do it IF you use an item (looking glass) which provides zoom vision. In an exploration game... where cliffs and falling are an important mechanics.";45.6;0.0;1.0;99.0;Posted: May 21

I respect the business practices and all the art that went into this game. I think there are truly excellent parts. It's very repetitive, the bosses are mostly unremarkable or unfair or simply annoying and the RPG elements are weaker than they've been in a Souls game in years. I can't recommend this game because it didn't make me feel anything new and was boring or annoying for the vast majority of the runtime.

For example, there are so many dungeons smattered throughout the world that are caves, catacombs, mines, etc. There are a few truly special ones, but once you've beaten one of the generic ones, you've beaten all of them. This system feels significantly worse than the much maligned chalice dungeons. Since the dungeons in Elden Ring are finite, I felt a desire or hope to find something really interesting and unique in them. Instead, they generally provide summons or weapons that were almost always useless. Without any extrinsic benefit, you'd hope that they'd be fun. Unfortunately, none of the dungeons provide satisfying puzzles and many of the bosses are just regular enemies from elsewhere put with a big health bar. Chalice dungeons had unique and good bosses, extrinsic benefits that couldn't be gotten anywhere else, and were a good mix of repetitive and challenging. This new dungeon system is a step backwards in most ways.

That's just one area of this game that really shows its weaknesses. There's too much content with a lack of originality and specialness. There's so much good here spread out with long open plains and peppered with crap to fill the world. Compared with the games from Ubisoft and their ilk, this is a triumph with commendable business practices and tons of wonderful elements. I think FromSoftware has released significantly better games in the past (Demon's Souls, Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne and Sekiro especially). You could probably play at least 2 or 3 of those in the time it'll take you for your first playthrough of Elden Ring. I highly recommend doing that instead.";96.8;0.0;2.0;72.0;Posted: May 17

I only had this game briefly, so keep that in mind.

Having said that, I was literally driven off by how actively hostile the controls are for PC players on mouse and keyboard. In theory, I imagine its possible to actually remap the controls to something that makes sense, but when the menu system assumes I've got a gamepad controller makes it almost impossible. C'mon, you can literally detect what devices I've got connected to my PC, and despite that, its telling me to hit a button on a gamepad that doesn't exist to confirm keybind changes.

After about fifteen minutes, and a couple Google searches on what the hell to do, I realized that I shouldn't have to be doing this to *start* a game.

Do not buy this game. Do not support FromSoftware's PC endeavors.

You can check my profile. I have over 800 hours of DS1, and over 800 hours of DS2 between base and SotFS. I have over 300 hours of DS3. I have played the Souls games.

I played the OG PC launch of DS1 where I had to download and tinker with mods just to get my mice to work, and unlocking the framerate meant you could slide down ladders and out of the world.

This is the BEST Souls game yet. Character customization is bomb, level design is bomb, story is bomb, weapons are cool. Sure, PVP is all Ashes damage and memes, and fundamentally kind of worse than the other Souls games, but I can forgive it.

What I cannot forgive is the absolute trash tier optimization, and port of this game. I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 7700K, both with mild overclocks and appropriate cooling, and the vast majority of my parts are bog standard safe, tried and true. I have NO issues in any other games, and I play Warframe at 1760p (Downsampling, don't ask) and get around 120 FPS.

How is there no widescreen support? How is there no unlocked FPS? How is it that I have to verify my game files every time that I launch the game? How does this game crash my WHOLE computer, no blue screen? How many fixes do I have to make? I spend about an hour of maintenance for every 10 hours of game play, maybe more. I have had 6 save file corrupts, and thankfully I know enough about hex editing to fix that, but not everyone does. Look at my hours in this game, that is all you need to know that this negative review is PURELY from their garbage optimization.

FIX YOUR GAME FROMSOFTWARE. THIS IS BAD.";239.8;0.0;3.0;43.0;Posted: May 20

I can confirm that the singleplayer campaign is truly great. The story is bit cheesy at times, but that's what you expect from a mainstream game that could be a Hollywood action blockbuster movie. Apart from that it is truly fun and original and there is not a single bit of filler content. I would even say it's the best 1st person shooter singleplayer campaign I've played in my life. The game also runs and looks great on max settings @1080p on my RX570.

Can't say anything about the multiplayer as I'm not that interested in it, but if you like 1st person shooters it's a must play for the campaign alone.";5.4;1.0;0.0;1113.0;Posted: May 22

Is Titanfall 2 good? Probably my favourite arcade style shooter
is Apex Legends good? Meh I guess for a free to play game
Would you rather pay 80 bucks for a new titanfall game rather than free updates on apex legends?
HELL YES
Will it ever happen?
No cause free to play fortnite style battle royales make more money than one time purchases like titanfall

Conclusion
If you enjoy apex legends the game has 2 times better movement (and apex legends movement is pretty good imo) more playstyles since you have access to not only pilot movesets but different titans. If you also come from apex legends all the weapons are the same and will be familiar to you.

Game's too easy, full achievements in 6 minutes.















Paying 6 bucks for this game was such a crime I paid another 6 bucks. It's a shame what happened to the game, regardless of circumstances, and I'd love to point fingers and say unpleasant things, but it'll only fall on deaf ears.

Gameplay & Mechanics: 10/10. Smooth, breakneck-paced, exhilarating. Gunplay is satisfying, TTK for Pilots is CS level low, and speed is your weapon. Titans feel powerful and dominant, but not overwhelming, and they're not slow, lumbering walking tanks. Adding in all the movement tricks available raises the skill ceiling to the moon (not that they're practical to use in MP).
Graphics: 8/10. It's Source engine yada yada , but it doesn't look old. Sure, there might not be RTX and 4K textures, and model clipping happens rather often, but there's not a frame that takes you out of immersion. Models are well detailed. Animations are fluid and of excellent quality.
Story: 7.7/10. It's a relatively cheesy story, and some parts of it are debatable. Nonetheless, it is paced quite well, ramping up the tension alongside stage difficulty, and ending in a sky-high climax. One of the oft-praised points about the story is the connection to the protagonist's Titan, and how masterfully the connection is built throughout the story, and I must agree.
Audio: 9/10. Punchy soundtrack, delightful sound effects, distinguishable gun sounds, skilled voice acting, combined with capable sound mixing. The double jump jet sound will never fail to activate my neurons.

You won't regret playing this game, unless you have very heavy motion sickness. Just buy it on sale, EA doesn't deserve this money, then Google Titanfall 2 Northstar if you're interested in multiplayer.";10.3;1.0;3.0;84.0;Posted: May 17

Have you ever heard the tragedy... of Titanfall 2?

I thought not. It's not a story EA would tell you. Titanfall 2 was the greatest FPS game ever made, so great in fact, that Ubisoft would try and miserably fail to rip off its finely crafted advanced movement mechanics. However, EA in their greed, released the game right between CoD Infinite Warfare and Battlefield 1, which ultimately led to its death, gone unnoticed by millions of potential fans. Is it possible to play this game...?

NOT FROM EA. The power of modding and third-party clients lead to many abilities some consider to be... UNNATURAL.

If you've read this far, I may as well go into more detail. In case it wasn't already clear, Titanfall 2 has the best movement, gunplay, and level design in any FPS I've ever played. Unfortunately, EA had no faith that this masterpiece would make them a mint, and thus chose the least desirable release date, essentially ruining TF2's chance at redemption from its mediocre predecessor, Titanfall. Had it not been from this ruthless corporate betrayal, this game would be so much more popular than it is right now.

This led to the game being hacked to the point of it being borderline unplayable with constant DDOS attacks. Unfortunately, Respawn has done nothing to fix this, instead focusing entirely on Titanfall's slightly less handsome, far more successful estranged cousin Apex Legends.

As a result, this gem has gone relatively un-noticed, and those who tried it were quickly turned away by the DDOS attacks and faulty servers. However, regardless of the multiplayer issues, the singleplayer Campaign still offers a truly magnificent experience for the 5-ish dollars when on sale. The story, although simple, works incredibly well thanks to great characters, breathtaking worlds, and mind-bending, evolving level design featuring (but not limited to) parallel time travel, convoluted moving platforms, and ship-boarding action. Giving nothing away, the ending is a real emotional roller-coaster of emotions.

Though the official servers may be beyond hope, there is a solution in the form of Northstar Client. This community-made mod bypasses all DDOS attacks and allows for countless possibilities for custom games, ranging from classic CtF to Infection to some other cursed abominations dreamed up by programmers running entirely on straight caffeine. The downside to Northstar is that all progression is removed, but the game options are debatably better than vanilla, not to mention safe from deranged hackers.

in terms of raw gameplay, I have yet to play a game that runs and feels as great as this one. TF2, like the other TF2, runs on the Source engine, meaning that basically any decent computer will be able to hit 60fps, even with gorgeous graphics, Movement is perfected, and level design accommodates stunts, shortcuts, and speedroutes. With the intricate system of slides, wall-runs, grappling, swinging, and even bunny-hopping, the skill ceiling for movement alone is extremely high. The progression system is fair, where most guns and equipment can be unlocked relatively quickly, but cosmetics will take a long time to completely unlock. There are microtransactions for special cosmetics, but honestly I just want to throw money at this game so consider it more of a donation and less an exchange. Pilot loadouts offer many combos or strategies, my personal favorite being a speed-oriented ability coupled with a completely random tactical ability to always keep opponents (and myself) on my toes.

If you still can't decide, just trust BT-7274. He always knows best, since he's done the math. And the math says that you WILL enjoy Titanfall 2.";8.7;1.0;0.0;20.0;Posted: May 20

It is incredibly sad this game didn't get the traction it deserves. I always enjoyed Titanfall 1 on the Xbox One so I decided to pick this one up since it was on sale and I was bored. Respawn for sure always knew what to do with movement systems and this game really was their final step towards mastering it within Apex Legends. The only gripe I have with this game is the lack of worthy progression and the death of the playerbase. Sure its an old game but I am occasionally having to wait longer than 2-3 minutes to hop into a game. But once again, bought it for 5$ on sale, which was completely worth it.

As of right now multiplayer is still hacked and at risk. Get this game when it goes on sale and play it for the campaign. It is one hell of a story campaign and at the time when it released was defiantly way ahead of its time. Each boss having its own personality though i wish they could get explored a bit more with a few more missions. But their mechanics are cool and very memorable scenes. The campaign is defiantly worth it if your waiting. Campaign wise 8.5/10 for it to be a 10 we need more campaigns to expand each boss and make the story longer.

^(idk why but i can't say the same for other games; i typically have to set quality to 'low' for good fps)

Cons:
-multiplayer is kind of lacking lately (not too many players, servers are slightly laggy)
-game doesn't receive as much support as other titles like Apex Legends
-takes a bit of time to learn";55.1;1.0;1.0;72.0;Posted: May 16

Best single player campaign story ever. Great fast action and awesome character development, Even made me cry at the end.. Anyway here is a plant based pie recipe I think you will like

A Proper (Vegan) Cornish Pasty with a flaky, buttery, rough puff pastry filled with tender veggies enveloped in a rich, thick, flavoursome sauce.

INGREDIENTS:
For the rough-puff pastry:
500g strong plain flour*
2 tsp salt
400g vegetable fat/shortening**
150ml ice cold water
For the filling:
200g potato, peeled and diced into 1cm cubes
100g swede, peeled and diced into 1cm cubes (yellow fleshed rutabaga)
75g mushrooms, chopped
75g onion, peeled and diced
8 tsp dairy free margarine
For the gravy:
200ml vegetable stock
3/4 tsp garlic powder
3/4 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp of dried rosemary.
1/4 tsp of dried thyme
1 tbsp nutritional yeast
1.5 tsp soy sauce
20g cornflour mixed with enough water to form a paste (approx 20ml)
To glaze:
30ml dairy free milk





To make the rough-puff pastry:
Sift the flour and salt into a bowl.
Using a knife, cut the vegetable shortening into small chunks into the bowl. Rub it loosely into the flour; you want to see chunks of shortening throughout, you don’t want to work it into breadcrumbs.
Make a well in the mixture and pour in the ice cold water. Mix it for a minute or two until you have a rough dough.
Cover your pastry and refrigerate it for 1 hour.
Once your pastry has chilled, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll it in one direction until it is a rectangular shape, roughly 20 x 50 cm. Don’t overwork the dough, you want to have a marble effect with visible streaks of the vegetable shortening running through it.
Position the dough rectangle in a portrait orientation in front of you.
Imagine the rectangle in thirds; fold the top third down to centre, then fold the bottom third up over it. Please see the recipe video for a visual demonstration.
Turn the dough a quarter turn to the left.
Roll it out to around three times its length and then fold it again as you did before - the top third over to the centre and then the bottom third up over it.
Cover the dough and place it back into the refrigerator for 1.5 hours.*** During this time you can cut up your veggies and make your gravy.

To make the gravy:
Combine the gravy ingredients into a small saucepan and whisk until it has reduced and become thick.
Once it has thickened, take your gravy off of the heat and leave to cool. As it cools it will develop a jelly-like consistency which will make it easier to add to your pasties.

To make your pasties:
Preheat your oven to 190C.
Once your pastry has finished chilling for the final time, roll it out, fold it and turn it as you did before and then roll it to around 1cm thick and use a small side plate (approx 18 cm) as a guide to cut out four circles. If you want monster pasties, use a dinner plate (approx 25cm) to cut out 2 large circles.
Being careful not to overfill your pasties, add your mixed vegetables on one half of each circle, add three teaspoons of the cold gravy over the top of the vegetables (evenly spaced) and 2 teaspoons of dairy free margarine per pasty. Add six teaspoons of the gravy if you're making monster pasties.
Brush a little water or dairy free milk around the edges of the pastry and fold it over. Crimp the edges by folding them over slightly. Please see the recipe video for a demonstration.
Cut three air holes in the top of each pasty and brush the top with the dairy free milk.
Put your pasties straight into the hot oven and cook for 40-50 minutes depending on the size you’ve decided to make. They should be ready when they are golden all over, including the base. Be careful - they'll be very hot inside!";7.6;1.0;1.0;29.0;Posted: May 17

Haven't played much on pc, but all I will say is, to anyone who is thinking about buying this game and is seeing all of the news about the mass DDOS raids, do not let it deter you. You can download the Northstar Client for completely free. Northstar is a mod that allows anyone to create a private server, making it very hard to hack all at once. Give it a try, this game is amazing and it sucks that Respawn refuses to fix this massive problem.";7.4;1.0;1.0;39.0;Posted: May 16

Titanfall 2
NOTE: I base this review on the solo experience with the Campaign as a whole.
As someone who has spent nearly 2000 hours at Apex Legends I became curios about this game when I heard about it being so extremely good and worth it just for the campaign alone. I started the campaign and played through it on Master difficulty (hardest). Of course it wasn't easy but it was useful to do the training course and beat the time for the achievement to get better at the movement.
The Good
Fantasic visuals, graphics and and atmosphere overall.
Great and intersting story which I would say the setting looks something like a mix between Halo and CoD series. Nice bosses and challenging enemies while still feeling fair and well balanced.
Fast paced fps with amazing gunplay and movement.
Very satisfying with weapons, enemies and characters and abilities being so familiar as an Apex Player. While mechs aren't in Apex Legends they were very nice too.
The Bad
Hackers ruining the multiplayer of Titan Falls so for the solo experience I can't find any cons.

The Conclusion
Titanfall 2 is a solid 10/10 and one of the best games I've played in any genre. While I exclusively base my review on the campaign I have no doubt that when the multiplayer works properly that the same can be said about it.
Its well worth the asking price even if you play the campaign quickly on a low difficulty, I only played it on Master once and went back to clean up some achievements but it was an amazing experience.

One of my favourite FPS of all time. The game is worth it from the single player campaigns alone, being one of the best campaigns ever imo. The multiplayer part of the game is not very newbie friendly with somewhat questionable weapon balancing, but it can be extremely fun once you get the movement down and start zooming across the map. There is really nothing quite like it out there.

Too bad the lack of interest from the devs pretty much killed off the official multiplayer scenes. Though there is a community mod for playing with custom servers instead, It's not the full multiplayer experience as some gamemodes are missing but what it currently offers is still very enjoyable.";12.1;1.0;1.0;376.0;Posted: May 16

Very refreshing take on a FPS game with a great movement system.

Gameplay is fast and fluid, and you can fly through the levels if you master the mechanics. There are lots of options for weapons, with a variety of SMG, Assault Rifles, Snipers and Grenades etc.

The Titan gameplay is the best part, with your Titan eventually having access to multiple weapon loadouts that can be switched to at any point the game. Titan fights feel amazing, its like Pacific Rim if you were fighting Mechs instead of monsters.

The campaign is a tad bit on the short side, playing the game on Regular I'd say you can finish the game in 5-6 hours but for me it almost hits the sweet spot. There are some collectables scattered throughout the maps, but from what I can see they give you nothing (which is a shame, since you collect Helmets)

Multiplayer is hit or miss, and I struggled to find games consistently, even when setting MP to include all modes.

The game pulls on your heart strings a little bit towards the end, but most of the NPC's are unlikable.

Its a great game, deserving of a sequel at the very least for this awesome movement system to continue in future multiplayer games. And lets be honest, we need a good Mech franchise in the gaming space at the moment.

If EA and Respawn want to print money, they need to make a sequel to this game.";16.2;1.0;1.0;145.0;Posted: May 22

Unlike Halo MCC where it's virtually impossible to find multiplayer matches in Asian regions, Northstar client does have them and the ping is very much playable, giving me the chance to finally experience the epitome of movement shooters.

To a big platformer fan, this shooter is a big pile of crack. Respawn really outdid themselves with the campaign, introducing a movement system so fluid and clean it feels like butter. To chain wall-running to a double-jump, back to a wall-run into a slide all while plugging enemies full of bullets feels great (especially in the last level). This really shines when you choose to play at an easier difficulty. It feels amazing to fly from enemy to enemy with ease. It all just flows. The hardest difficulty isn't that much of a pushover either. It forces you to play more defensively, but there's plenty of times where the platforming will still shine. Just don't be surprised when you turn a corner and get blasted immediately bringing you back to the last checkpoint. The story itself was nothing special, but it was very fun to play.

Multiplayer on the other hand, basically doesn't exist. I shouldn't of had to, but I was forced to download third party servers to play on. What little I played (for the time being) was very fun. Highly polished shooter with pilots flying around all over the place, each of them insurmountably better than I.

Yeah this game is worth getting for sure. If you're willing to go the extra step to download Northstar, then you're bound to have a great PvP experience too. That's all that really matters too, is that you have fun with it!";8.3;1.0;0.0;44.0;Posted: May 18

a damn good score
level design and parkor obstacles are really good

All in all, is a rad game, get rid of origin

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: ""But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!"" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

""Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1.""

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.";0.9;1.0;0.0;169.0;Posted: May 16

Titanfall 2 is a heck of a lot of fun. Definitely the best advanced-movement game I've ever played, plus big stompy robots. But it's not without it's shortcomings either. Let's get in to it.

The campaign is amazing. An decent story complemented by excellent gameplay. The voice acting is good, but the length of the campaign is unfortunate. I completed it within about 5-7 hours, and it's not very replayable immediately. Plus if you do go back and play a mission, you might have to sit through unskippable cutscenes. The boss fights were decent, however. Each one has a different loadout that you will eventually get to use later after killing them. Good but short campaign.

The multiplayer by itself isn't great, the servers have a tendency to suddenly stop working, but they gameplay is great. Leveling is ok, but hindered by server crashes. You also might have to wait up to ten minutes to find a match. THERE IS A FIX, though! The Northstar mod is super easy to install, and once you do, their servers are much more stable and there is always people online. There's even custom gamemodes.

Nobody really plays frontier defense, the PVE mode, and I have never been able to join a match, so I won't review it here.

Titanfall 2 was lightning in a bottle for advanced movement shooters, but unfortunately abandoned by it's creators. Campaign is great but too short, multiplayer is great but basically requires mods to run. Good game, bad company.

A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing game!

Campaign is great, although short so if you're looking to get the game only for the campaign get it while it's on sale. Campaign itself is replayable in my opinnion, every moment of it is worth replaying.

MP matches are great, I like frontier defence the most personally, servers aren't really ""filled with hackers"" and ""DDOS'd"", I played many MP rounds and so far I had no such problem.

Hope this helps you decide if you want to buy it or not.";20.4;1.0;0.0;22.0;Posted: May 20

This is and has always been the most underrated game in history. I think with Titanfall 3 release I hope it'll get the love it deserves. If you don't like the multiplayer, its highly advised to play the campaign. Titanfall 1 didn't have a campaign so don't worry. 5 bucks there's no excuse at this point. Good Luck Pilot.

I love mech games. I love first person shooters. This is literally the best of both worlds. Mech games can be clunky and fps games can lack depth. This solves both problems by melding the two into an amazing game that I wish was longer. While playing through the campaign I thought to myself I wish it was like a TV Show. New episodes every new season, perpetually. I would play new but similar scenarios of this game for the rest of my life. Seriously, I miss Mech Warrior and this fills a gap in my heart I didn't realize was missing. Thanks!";19.9;1.0;0.0;9.0;Posted: May 22

story is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ baller but u gotta go to websites and perform dark magic by downloading other launchers to play with the few active players using multiplayer. so dont buy it and expect to jump straight into multiplayer, you gotta put a lil effort first. once you do that you're gonna have the time of your life playing one of the most legendary movement shooters to date.

I've bought this game 3 times now, put tons of hours in on other platforms, and even with the state of servers and EA in general I don't regret it one bit. This is easily the best FPS game in the past decade and as bold as that is to claim, I boot it back up again and think yup, it's that good.

The campaign alone deserves to go down as one of the greatest, it's so brisk and fresh, so many smart ideas that never overstay their welcome, and so genuinely beautiful from an artistic perspective that I don't see this game ever aging. The game is also insanely well optimized, i've never had issues with it and my recent sessions at max settings, 4k at a solid 120fps is eye candy to behold.

For how cheap the game is running nowadays it's a no brainer. Respawn, EA, please get the servers fixed, this game's worth it, and since they won't, the northstar mod takes a little setup but it works.";5.3;1.0;2.0;1649.0;Posted: May 16

Originally, I bought Titanfall 2 in 2019 for my PS4. I played through the campaign, but didn't touch the Multiplayer much. Then, in 2020, I got really into the Multiplayer and soon, I was G11 (meaning around level 550, max lvl is G100).

In 2021, I didn't find as much time to play the game. Unfortunately, during 2021, Titanfall 2 began to die out, with the servers getting DDosed 24/7 and with EA not being interested in allocating resources to fix the servers, this left the game pretty much dead, which was an incredible shame as to date, Titanfall 2 is Multiplayer game.

Then, that same year, there suddenly became a fix in the form of community run Northstar-servers. Suddenly, Titanfall 2 was alive again and not only that, the Northstar-servers brought with them new game modes like Gun Game and much more. And when footage of the Northstar run games started popping up online, I knew I had to try them out.

So, in 16.5.2022, while it was on sale, I went and bought the game again. For now, the original servers are running again but nevertheless, I'll be trying out Northstar once I get to installing it.

10/10 game, incredible multiplayer and an original campaign without much substance, but with the levels themselves varying between great and extraordinary.";8.2;1.0;3.0;142.0;Posted: May 18

best campaign in fps game ever with good parkour level design, best movement that makes you feel really like a monkey, and has a decent lore and story with great scifi art direction (very tacticool, no ho mo bullsht like apex)
too bad Respawn abandoned the game, but the community is so great with the made of Northstar client plus some Asian/JPN servers are more active than BF3, hence being a TF2 games never die (both Titanfall and Team Fortress xD)

should you buy it now? definitely. although origin su ck as s, it's definitely worth for the campaign (has decent replayability) plus a few years of mulitplayer revived by Northstar";6.5;1.0;0.0;172.0;Posted: May 18

BEFORE YOU PURCHASE:
My favorite shooting game. I don't know of any that can really match the fun I have had with this game. However, the servers are all but gone. There seems to be no hope for repairing this. This means no new events, no new maps, no new guns, no new skins, no new titans, no new abilities, and when the servers still worked, a low player count. The devs don't care for this game anymore. The modding community which could be shut down at any moment is the only reason this game still is playable. I love this game so much after my origin account was stolen the first time and origin didn't let me get my account back i bought it again. If only apex legends was not the only focus of this company.

This game was great back in the day, and if you can get it to run and find matches, you'll likely love it.

HOWEVER!

For a lot of people, myself included, getting the game to launch is nearly impossible. And when it does launch, you'll struggle to find a match, when you do find a match, don't be surprised if you get a timeout error while connecting.

Also apparently there's a ton of hackers in the game, I don't know for sure because I can't get into a match.";0.2;0.0;8.0;201.0;Posted: May 17

It feels good to play, but the game is mostly pvp, so I can see it getting boring really quick, the campaign is so short that it feels more like a tech demo, and ends with this almost condescending ending where your guy talks about what hes going to do next, like there's room for a sequel, and you're actually supposed to care about any of the characters that were on screen for like 5min max at any time. Its a 5-8 hour long game that acts like its taken 20 hours to build up lore and flesh out characters, and for that it feels extremely half baked.

I would normally just trash talk a game that has this little actual content; but I got it on sale for less than $5.00, and if you can get a discount like that again any point down the line; that's where I'd say you're getting your money's worth.

EDIT: Just went into pvp, unstable servers, the most barebones customization, and a microtransaction system that restricts access to your ability to purchase a $20 buy everything pack if you have a single thing from said pack on its own (which is standard with the only version of the game you can purchase).

TL:DR sad EA cashgrab is sad EA cashgrab, I'm glad I only spent like $5 to buy it.";14.1;0.0;0.0;207.0;Posted: May 20

I'm disappointed.

So, to follow this up I want to go through why. I redownloaded Titanfall 2 Last night hoping to go have a good time with my friend: he convinced me to redownload so we can goof around in a 1 on 1 match where we'd beat the snot out of each other.

I go through 3 hours of redownloading the game when I finally get to the menu. It should be a straight shot to the Multiplayer - even straighter of a shot considering that this would be a 1v1 between with a friend.

I am unable to access Multiplayer. I don't mean that the server list is empty, I mean that I cannot press the Multiplayer button. I've spent over seven hours today just trying to find fixes to get around this issue. I've gone to a 6-Year-old forum post trying to find a fix to this issue. When that failed I decided to verify the game files, hoping that it was still something that I might be able to fix without a heavy commitment on my part: I did that for a second time with no discernable effect.

I decided to hell with it and uninstalled the game so that I could reinstall it, wasting another 3 hours hoping to try and get it running again. I finally get back in and find that nothing had changed. By this point, I download NorthStar hoping to circumvent the Respawn Servers, which did fix a few issues: Namely finally getting the game to register it was connected to servers, and allow for the information that would display on the righthand side of the menu screen to reappear.

It didn't do a thing. Multiplayer is still locked out for me, and I am stuck in an infinite search for the Respawn Servers. I hate this. I shouldn't have to be expected to run loops just to get my own game working just so I can play a match that at most would likely last 33 Minutes. What I hate most about all of this is that I LOVE this game: I've played through the campaign around six times already, and I have nearly all of the achievements for this game - and on top of that while trying to wait to see if the servers would show themselves I decided to play it again, getting halfway through it as of the time of this writing.

I'm just frustrated that this game: which I know was working prior to me uninstalling the game for space, will let me access the Multiplayer perfectly well. I also know that as of late the game servers have been under attack by petty vindictive manchildren who are incapable of having any agency or power in their own lives and have turned to DDOSing the servers to deny anyone the ability to play.

I am fairly certain that the servers I'm a part of are not undergoing a DDOS attack: I've been checking the Steam Forums and Reddit Forums for solutions all day and I haven't seen any indication of a server-wide attack denying people access to the Multiplayer.

I hate what I've done here in making this review, but I feel it's warranted for the time being: if you go ahead and decide to buy this game I really hope you don't regret it: I've gotten mostly nothing but enjoyment out of it all. However, as of right now this issue has left nothing but a foul taste in my mouth.

As of currently, I do not recommend buying Titanfall 2 if you were hoping to play the Multiplayer, in any capacity. For the current situation, I'd only buy the game for its Campaign. I genuinely hope for the future that whatever it is that's causing this issue that appears to be affecting me is resolved.";41.4;0.0;0.0;112.0;Posted: May 21

This game is actually decent. I can kind of recommend it if you KIND OF like mechs and you enjoy a typical, old school formula FPS.

If mechs give you more than a passing interest, this game really doesn't cut it. It's literally a scaled up FPS, and what's worse is the campaign barely cares about giving you proper mech battles. Outside of the mech combat, you have a very competent but incredibly straightforward shooter that's focused on cloaking, wall running, and double jumping, and there are some other gimmicks in the story like time travel that make parkour interesting for like 3 minutes before you move on to something else. I left the game each time feeling like I mildly enjoyed it. It really has no flaws to speak of. It just doesn't do anything new or interesting. The mech combat is just ok. The parkour is just ok, and the shooting is just ok. Other games of this caliber focusing on a single one of these aspects instead of all 3 at once will surely be better.

Also, I'm writing strictly about the campaign mode because PVP is essentially dead. I don't think it's off to say this was probably supposed to be a PVP game first with the campaign added to get more buyers, because the campaign is a little short and shallow all by itself.";11.1;0.0;1.0;419.0;Posted: May 21

You need to have an EA account and Origin installed (had to recover my EA password cuz it's been 15 years since I last logged in LUL)
Played the campaign on Hard difficulty. Solid gameplay and graphics. You cannot ask for more.
Now about multiplayer.... the community doesn't have a consensus but I'm trying to be unbiased here: It's not working properly connection wise. From what I've gathered there has been a lot of DDoS attacks on the servers and EA abandoned ship, at least from trying to stabilize them.
You're stuck on a scuffed ass multiplayer connection where you can get timed out constantly while trying to find a match, wait 5 minutes after just clicking the multiplayer button, another 5-10 minutes to get into a match. So it's a suboptimal experience, WAIT FOR A SALE LIKE I DID.
(edit: If you're trying to play this without any friends, consider the server issues 5x worst)
Northstar client fixes these connection issues, although dedicated servers are on Europe and North America, so most of the 3rd world gang gets that 200+ ping treatment. And some game modes are locked in there rip.";42.3;0.0;4.0;33.0;Posted: 18 May

Finding a game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ project. If you want to play with friends, good luck. You will invite each other to the team and you have an average changes of getting an invite after 3-4 requests. Then once you go into a party, you have a chance of about 1 in 5 to actually get into a match, since most of the time you are going to get disconnected.
Worst part is you can prepare the loadout as much as you want, but if you get a disconnect, everything will be returned. My friend reached lvl 50 to increase his gen, it took us 1 HOUR to be able for him to do his gen, and get into a match. I think we had 20 tries and each damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ try he had to do it ALL OVER AGAIN. I don't know if it's DDoS attacks or what not, but at this point either stop supporting the damn game if you are that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid and can't put a DDoS protection in place (And this happens in Apex Legends as well, mostly in ranked) or hire someone with at least half a brain that can write the damn code properly.

Let me start by saying that this game is absolutely a very good game with very nice graphics and it runs smooth as silk. Its probably well worth the money if you play online. If you're not into online play, though, this game is only good when you get it at a MASSIVE discount. With only 9 hours of gameplay in 'offline' mode (and I've been slacking with progressing) its hard to get value for the money.

At the end of the day the storyline is very straightforward and the story is too short, but the gameplay itself is very good, as are the graphics.";9.7;0.0;0.0;240.0;Posted: May 21

WARNING TO ALL PROSPECTIVE PLAYERS:

The online servers are absolute trash, and you MUST HAVE MODS in order to get the servers to matchmake smoothly. The average wait time for matchmaking, assuming you have no mods, is twelve minutes. It is a slim chance you actually get to enter a game before the server times out for one of its many arbitrary reasons.

If all you're looking for is a single player campaign in the style of games such as Mech Warriors and the like, go ahead and get this on a heavy sale.

I, however, will be refunding this hunk o' junk and never looking back.";1.8;0.0;12.0;138.0;Posted: May 16

First, you will have some starting issues. It downloads some 80GB over Steam at some slow rate. Then it installs its own Steam-like gaming platform. Then you can run.

The single player campaign first becomes ""can you hit these jump right"" and then ""guess where you are supposed to go""..... Just not a good game.";12.2;0.0;0.0;99.0;Posted: May 20

From an objective standpoint, you cannot advertise your game as PVP or co-op if you do not maintain the official servers or at least have a browsing ability for players to readily access private servers.

It's still a good game, even though it's missing a lot of potential because EA shelved it. But this is a hazard to consumers, and I cannot fathom how you can possibly still sell/market this game legally. (I mean Northstar exists, and I don't want to prevent people from potentially buying and using the northstar client but this is more of a shot at EA than anything.)

How can EA get away with this legally? Offering an easily accessible multiplayer mode which is actively harmful to the consumer because it is unprotected. Like, on one end I don't want them to remove multiplayer because I know clients like Northstar exist, and even with Dark Souls people had been patching multiplayer with Blue Sentinel. On the other hand, how is this even legal for EA to do? I've seen companies get sued for way less than this, but EA can do this freely? They don't even have to like, notify their players that this is an issue with an in-game announcement or warning, or even anything on the community tab. They can just sit back and watch the money flow in.

I love you Titanfall 2, but publishers can suck, and I can't take your side on this review. This is actively harmful to consumers, and the only official awareness about the issues with the multiplayer is by word of mouth among the consumers.";119.4;0.0;6.0;970.0;Posted: May 19

Game seems good, it's nice to have a brain-free FPS once in a while. But I don't recommend buying it because but I haven't made nearly enough progress to judge because it...
- requires the Origin launcher to run
- seems to crash randomly (no other game does this!)
- frequently just doesn't launch, or crashes before the level begins, requiring a reboot to fix it
I hadn't realised it was EA until after I'd handed over the money, but having read online that seems to explain most of the problems.";10.2;0.0;1.0;180.0;Posted: May 19

I wanted to wait until I completed the main story before leaving a review, and wow. This is the best game that I have ever played, if you take out the issues that come with the Rockstar Launcher. The graphics are out of this world, the story is amazing, the character development is great, I truly can't speak highly enough of this game.

Like I previously mentioned, the Rockstar Launcher caused a lot of issues for me. It does not work well with the Steam overlay, the game would crash because I was ""out of memory"" when playing on a graphics setting significantly lower than what my PC can handle. I wish Rockstar would take the time to look into this and other issues even though this is an older title. This is such a wonderful game, it deserves the extra attention to fix these small problems to make the game play more enjoyable.

Overall, this is a fantastic game. If you have the ability, I would recommend playing this title on an Xbox or PlayStation unless you only have a PC.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games I've ever played. I still have some sidequests that I haven't finished so I'm definitely planning to play this game more, but the story alone was worth buying this game. It's very well written and meaningful, the graphics are amazing and the characters are actually interesting instead of being empty/lifeless husks.

Story made me sad for a whole week, gave me a sense of dread before every mission and I still get sad when I hear the ending song.

I suppose I do recommend it.

if you're unfamiliar with Red Dead, it's GTA in the old west. If you, like me, thought the first one was boring as ♥♥♥♥... You may want to give this one a try. It's about as challenging as GTA (not very), but it's relatively fun.

I almost asked for a refund about an hour in, because it's a complete railroad for the first 60ish minutes, then it becomes an open world.";83.1;1.0;0.0;164.0;Posted: May 20

Single player story is amazing. Completely recommend it.

Multiplayer is a mixed bag. It can be fun with friends if you like to do online missions, hunting/fishing trips, or just harassing npcs. However, Rockstar doesn't seem to care about giving it any new content.
Another issue is it's riddled with hackers. Rockstar will bad you for kicking hackers from a game but not the hackers themselves.

QUICK TIP:
There is a Nexus mod called RDO Lobby Manager that you can create your own private lobby for you and your friends. 100% recommend going this route at first. Make some money. Level up. Then maybe you can survive in the wild west with hackers ;)

It IS looked down upon by Rockstar to use this. Haven't heard of anyone getting banned yet, though I have heard of warnings. Just make sure you don't dupe items or do anything that would get you banned normally.";79.0;1.0;1.0;263.0;Posted: May 19

I Shortly Tell You About The Game :
At First I Had No Idea That How The Game Could Be And I Even Thought What IF I Don't like It .
But Now After Only 5 Hours I'm Saying That It's a Masterpiece ! As It has 10/10 Score In IGN .
Words Are Not Enough To Describe How Amazing & Great The Game Is , At least For Me ^^

Final Tip: It's More Than ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" :)";45.0;1.0;4.0;58.0;Posted: 18 May

One of the greatest games EVER made. Rockstar once again has proved to make the wait worth it for this sequel 8 years in the making. The level of detail is unmatched on this western epic and a game that truly should not be missed.

I almost completed one full playthrough of the single player campaign and I feel that I should be qualified to write a review. So here it goes...

Red Dead Redemption 2 is personally for me one of the greatest games I have ever played. The level of graphics, attention to detail, richness of the vast open world makes it a truly unique playing experience.

On highest details the game looks a lot like the real world. With your headphones on you can hear the nature around you, when you hunt or when you just pass by on your mission.

You can profile yourself as the good gangster with heart or the bad gangster without mercy. Or also something inbetween, depending on the choices you make.

Prepare to travel the world of wild wild west and participate in a wide variety of rich quests that fit in really well. From robbing and killing to helping and hunting, the choice is yours.

This is absolutely my favorite game. The one and only thing I wished was that they added more stables, they encourage you to ""collect em all"" with the horses but only allow a limited amount to be kept. On the same topic I wished they added more horses to the game in general. Since time actually passes in the game and progression can be seen in animal populations, building progress and people migration I wish it was possible to raise horses and such, it would add to the game after arthurs passing. Other than that, Its a wonderful game and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves open world games.";9.0;1.0;0.0;69.0;Posted: May 22

- Over 50 hrs of campaign, hundreds if you like doing sidequests
- beautifully told stories
- bad ass music
- photo mode

Cons :
- not that well optimised, (1660 ti) heavy hardware requirement
- graphics over gameplay
- online gameplay had little content
- sometimes its a drag to fast travel";101.2;1.0;0.0;372.0;Posted: May 18

Played this game for the first time on my PS4, then bought it on PC when i got one. Easily my favorite game. It is filled with details and an amazing story, every side quest feels like it's thought out. Its gameplay could be better but with the animations and fluidity of it all, you can look past it. The game can also feel somewhat restricted when you for example try to ride to the area you're supposed to be, but since you're faster than the NPC you're following, you go to far and have to restart.
The games online has huge potential but r* doesn't seem to care about it.
Overall i would recommend this game. made be want to be a cowboy.";20.9;1.0;1.0;19.0;Posted: May 20

In short: This is not just a game. This is a work of art in the world of video games. Such games come out once every 10 years. And such games can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Rockstar really made a real masterpiece, which sets the bar so high that it’s unlikely that something else will come out within 5 years. Maximum attention to detail, to the world around, to the plot, to the characters. This is a game made not just for money, it is made with a real soul for all those who are not afraid to spend hours exploring this world, for those who want to really think about some moral values that the game itself raises. In just 230 hours of playing, I was able to feel all this atmosphere of the wild west. For me, this game is one of the best I have ever played. The game is worth every penny spent on it, every hour spent on it. All this will be returned to you in a package of fierce emotions that you will receive during the passage. This game gets 10 out of 10 without any hesitation (personally, in my opinion). Definitely advise, play and enjoy the game!";230.1;1.0;0.0;38.0;Posted: May 16

I have owned this game on 3 platforms now, after purchasing it on Steam.
It is totally worth it. It continues to be my favorite game ever, even though I have never been particularly interested in the Wild West game genre.
Quite literally every aspect of this game is perfection, or at worst: stupendously close to it.
There is no need for further explanation. No matter who you are, you will enjoy this game.";32.7;1.0;0.0;33.0;Posted: May 17

Engaging story with meaningful characters at every corner. The vast majority of side quests and strangers feel individually unique and bring a compelling piece of themselves that feels like it all belongs as part of the main story, even if it doesn't depend on it.

Superb audio, music soundtrack, and graphics.

My only complaint is that your character (in single-player) cannot smoke a cigarette or cigar longer than one puff before discarding it. I do not mean to glorify smoking, but it does feel odd that I cannot do that in a time setting that was so heavily dominated by tobacco as an integral part of entertainment, medicine, and culture.

Amazing game";105.0;1.0;0.0;100.0;Posted: May 23

Single player: Probably the best story Rockstar has ever created. The visuals are top tier. The world and characters are both realistic and entertaining. If you haven't played it yet I highly recommend.
Multiplayer: Unfortunately it seems that Rockstar has kinda abandoned it, or at leasts neglects it. There could be soo much more to the experience but it comes off as rushed or kind of half assed. However its still pretty fun with friends if you want to do some hunting or bounties.";62.5;1.0;0.0;296.0;Posted: May 19

Red Dead Redemption 2 is definitely one of the best Rockstar Games. Has a really great story and is a love letter to westerns. A great game that really sticks with you. Red Dead Online is pretty solid as well and I love that option of creating a Native American character but online is a bit glitchy and while it is still playable, I'd play it more if Rockstar gave a patch to it. I still prefer GTA Online. But the great story in the single-player campaign still makes this well worth buying. Highly recommended!";29.9;1.0;0.0;221.0;Posted: May 22

Overall a great game. The only issue that I have is with the TAA. Turning the slider up for TAA will cause the screen to get pixelated whenever you turn your mouse really fast. 10/10 story, 10/10 game mechanics, (real life logic applies for most of them) and 9/10 open world. (I can't give it a 10/10 for the open world because almost all the states in game are eastern states except for two. New Austin is New Mexico, West Elizabeth is eastern Texas, west New Hanover is Oklahoma, east New Hanover is Arkansas, Lemoyne is Louisiana, and Ambarino is Colorado.)";76.2;1.0;0.0;45.0;Posted: May 22

It's mostly a slow game when it comes to game play mechanics. Lots of driving around in carts, horses etc, but while doing so you also get to watch an incredibly beautiful landscape, where each frame could potentially be a painting. Colours are amazing and the environmental effects are very well done. Stylistically this game is near perfect. Story wise it's quite empty and has not much to say, except for some platitudes about the inevitable industrialization and the state owned authority on violence rather than the individual. I can't understand why this game make people emotional really. There is nothing much that resembles any real life connections between the characters. It's all just surface level relationships that are very cliched. The only time I felt this game made some sense to me was the home building sequence at the very end, since all of a sudden the character realized he could be a master of his own fate, rather than to follow a snake tongued leader (Dutch) that was duplicitous and cowardly. Basically the Wild West was a place for liars to tell lies about some future payoff with a big score when all they had to do was to settle down and stop pursuing impossible ideals . Grounding oneself ultimately is redemption.";71.7;1.0;0.0;229.0;Posted: May 22

I've played through the main story of this game twice now and never have I felt such emotional attachment to a character like I have Arthur Morgan, this was, is and always will be one of the best games I have ever played. The art, world design, story/plot, acting, music oh that music!

Everything about this game is just on a whole other level; I always liked westerns, movies mainly but playing this it enveloped me into it I felt like I was there, it made me feel like I was Arthur and that was the truly amazing part about this game it's hard to believe this game is 4 years old already it feels like it released last week.

Aside from the occasional glitch or lag spike here and there, I have really no complaints about this game so would I recommend it? Of course I would, and well if you haven't played or even heard about this game already I truly do feel sorry for you because you are missing out on one hell of a masterpiece of gaming history.

This game deserves to go down in history as one of the best games ever made.";269.4;1.0;0.0;24.0;Posted: May 18

There are some toxic players online that will camp out an kill your HORSE ( which SUCKS they expensive ) but other then that the online is fine ( Have not played online again since I lost my 1st horse. poor ROACH I loved him for all 5 min that I had him LOL ) GREAT GAME finally have the time to really sit down and play it. 8 out of 10 ( single player ) 4 out of 10 ( online < R.I.P ROACH > )";7.7;1.0;0.0;570.0;Posted: May 19

Doom, Zelda, God Of War, Diablo, GTA, Bioshock, Starcraft, The last of us, Half Life- All those ""best games of all time"" contenders. I've played them all extensively.

This is better.

Story, dialog, quests, sidequests, collectibles, combat, gunplay, non-combat activities, base upgrades, weapon and character customization, graphics, animations, ""Immersiveness""... I can go on and on listing the amazing things in this game has to offer. I should also mention- the majority of that list would be things this game does BETTER THAN ANY GAME BEFORE IT OR SINCE.

For a game with well over 150hrs of REAL content, its amazing how little I can find to complain about here.
The gunplay can become slightly repetitive if you choose to fight from behind cover all the time?
I'd like to see some additions to the single player campaign/ Epilogue. I'm worried that's not going to happen since its been 3 years but I would GLADLY pay for that.

This game is worth every penny and then some.

I don't even know where to begin with this game. As a grown man, Red Dead Redemption 2 has hit me right in the feels, and I feel like writing this review is part of the healing process for some of the emotions it put me through. I absolutely love this game, it's a masterpiece.

For a game released in 2018, I'll fully admit that I'm late to the show. I was never a fan of Westerns or the 19th century as a setting, but this game single-handedly changed all of it. The experiences I will detail here will be focused on my singleplayer / Story playthrough, with a brief synopsis of online play. At the very bottom I'll include a tl;dr for those who just want a quicker review.

I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 with no prior knowledge of the franchise and on a whim when I was going through a gaming dry spell around early winter in 2018. Right off the bat, my opinion was that the game was designed with a console audience in mind, but I tried it regardless. While the intro mission was impressive and the graphics were gorgeous, I couldn't get into it, grew impatient, and had the game refunded.

2 years later in 2020, I saw the game on sale, decided I had been too harsh, and picked it up again. This time I played through the entire introduction and strove to acclimate myself to the clunky PC controls. Once it was over, I didn't quite feel it, so I uninstalled but kept the game, this time with the promise that I'd eventually get around to playing it.

Now we're in 2022, I don't know what prompted it, but two weeks ago I reinstalled and jumped back in. The controls were still frustrating and took time to get accustomed to, but this time I gave the game the chance it deserved without letting my mood swings get in the way, and it was then that I realized what a gem I had this whole time, just gathering dust in my virtual library.

Red Dead Redemption 2 puts you in the shoes of Arthur Morgan, a character I had never heard of prior to getting into this series, but I feel more connected to him than I have with any other character in a game, outstripping my emotional investment in all the heroes and villains I've encountered in countless RPG's since the early 2000's. Arthur's journey is as raw and human as it gets and touches upon some existential questions such as the meaning of it all, redemption, family, destiny, and loyalty. The mundane, slice of life details in the game from greeting strangers on the road, hunting, camping, eating stew / drinking coffee, providing for the gang, and various other side activities aren't just there for fluff, they're meant to help you live and breathe as Arthur Morgan and become him. Thus when the events that transpire further down the line come to pass, you feel them as if you the player is going through it all, not some pre-made fictional protagonist you happen to be controlling. I would love to say more, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.

Your choices in the game do matter, as there are different endings depending on your conduct. I'm not going to tell you not to rush or take your time. Personally, I felt a bit lost after the introduction and was thrown into this vast world of horses, wild animals, and a gigantic map to explore. It all feels very ""is this it?"" or ""What am I supposed to do now?"" at first if you don't bother with the story. Let it guide you, and explore side activities in between, you won't regret it. I found an early focus on story helped me feel more invested in it all, then I took breaks to work on side activities and exploration.

Online play is, as you'd expect, a vastly different experience. Regretfully, there isn't a way to just play co-op with friends, so you'll have to endure a world full of the typical crowd you'll often face online. It's kill or be killed, and if you think ""I won't be a ♥♥♥♥, I'll let this person go without bothering them"", expect to get a bullet in the back of the skull once you turn your back. I found that the only way to get anything done in online is to shoot first, ask questions later. Overall, online play can be fun, but it's a hollow imitation of the story mode, and the fact that you can dump real life money into it to get ahead kinda spoils the need to grind and put in effort, or maybe I'm just too old school and have a lower tolerance for that kind of thing at this point.


Too Long Didn't Read:
- Clunky PC controls that take some getting used to and tweaking
- Amazing singleplayer experience. So many easter eggs to discover, the game rewards completion
- Dog eat dog online experience that doesn't do the game justice unless PvP is all you care about or you have friends to tag along with you
- Story will probably make you cry and make you fall in love with Westerns if they weren't your thing prior to this
- You may randomly start saying phrases like ""Ya hear?"", ""My boah"" and ""You're arright girl"" in daily speech, along with a testosterone boost and greater facial hair growth

I have over 200 hours between my preorder on Xbox One, the Online Only version on Epic and I just bough it on here.

TL;DR: Buy it on 60% or more sale JUST for the story. Story is amazing and detailed. The Online mode is utter horseshyte and abandoned by R* (still plenty of players). Online has about 8 missions, in total, if you don't buy the Roles at 25 gold + 15 for the BH extra pass (There's 5 roles. That's 49.99 for 150 gold bar pack). Plus there's plenty of the customization content behind the gold paywall. It's designed, just like GTAO, to frustrate you into opening your wallet. Also, y no Undead Nightmare?

I recommend the story mode and DO NOT recommend the online mode. Story mode is beautiful, albeit still buggy at times. Favorite part: Good Arthur is completely different from Bad Arthur. You even get completely new or different cut scenes and the world responds to Arthur differently. Story is really detailed. Still think the story in RDR1 is better, and nothing touches Undead Nightmare.

Online mode is utter BS, though. It has Gold as a real money currency you can buy, or gain in game at a jokingly slow rate (0.1 - 0.4 per job/event/Dailies) but all the Roles (5 in total) cost 25 gold bars (that's 25.0, not 0.25), and the Prestigious Bounty Pass is 15. That's 140 gold bars ($49.99 USD) to do ever Role, which you know you will end up buying, because there are like...8 missions for some lady trying to avenge her husband. That's it....8 f**king missions. There are no ""free"" versions of the Roles, so that's online story content locked behind a paywall. BTW, there are tons of clothing items and gun customization options that are paywalled, as well. All this, and zero property, zero bank jobs or ""GTA heist-like"" content and zero criminal Roles in a game where the story mode is a western centered around gang life.

A lot of the money making content is poorly designed. For instance, if you're a trader and you do a long haul (which usually takes about 10-12 minutes to cross the map at full speed), you'll almost always come upon a shootout between 20ish badguys and two (F**king two) sellers defending themselves. If the two sellers die, even if you are alive and kill everyone, you lose everything in your cart. We won't even bring up why 20 douchebags need to attack two dudes with no valuables (because I haven't delivered them yet) and focus on the fact that you are literally still sitting on the full cart, you can see the items are there and nothing is lost, you can take it right back to camp, but no, they are all now lost in the attack and you have to go hunt all over again THEN wait on Crips to remake the cargo. Which btw, supplies are now on a faster use rate (he burns through animal parts like 50 men are using them) and supply missions now give almost no bar fill.

Also, in typical ""big R* brain"" fashion, the longer you wait to turn in missions, the better your reward. The longer you hold on to a bounty target before dropping in a jail cell, the more you get in cash, XP and Gold. This promotes waiting as a tactic which adds extra risk of dying to other players (and GTAO/RDO players are scum of the earth and will kill you for existing) or the bounty getting away for whatever reason (they can slip their ties, even in the more expensive bounty hunter rope). Any other game would pay you a bonus for getting jobs done early. This games online play is a grand example of R*'s terrible MTX practices and how most of their mechanics are designed to frustrate you into buying gold (or Shark Cards in GTAO) to speed up progression that's otherwise designed to make you wait for better results. These are all purpose designed frustration mechanics, not immersion or realism details. To back this up, you can change the currency type from in game dollars to gold on all weapons, horses and clothing customization items if you don't have enough cash.

I'd not be so mad if they still worked on the game and had more content, but they pulled the RDO team for the abysmally bad GTAV Extended new gen release. Also, unlike GTAO which gets semi regular content updates to this day, this game seems to have been completely abandoned since Halloween 2021 and has about 1/20th the content of GTAO. So they lied about that ""we are 100% focused on RDO right now"", especially when we were told it took ""2 years"" for them to do the new gen GTA. That's 2 years the RDO team was pulled from a project they were ""100% focused on"".";19.6;1.0;0.0;427.0;Posted: May 19

Took me a little while to get into it, because it was nothing like any game I had ever played before. But when I got a couple of hours in the story, I was hooked . This game has, by far, the best story-telling in any game I have played. It’s like playing an incredibly well directed movie. The music is good and so well used, that it had me shed a tear or two more than once when a song started a the exact right moment. The interaction with npcs is so fluid that it feels natural. Even shopping seems like a realistic experience in this game. The visuals are breathtaking. In the end, I just wanted to get up and start applauding like at the theater after a really good movie! (Yeah, I do that…)
Give this game a chance, you won’t regret it.";84.3;1.0;0.0;61.0;Posted: May 23

Quite possibly the best written videogame of all time. The story is phenomenal, and this game is worth buying just for that.

The gameplay, on the other hand, is serviceable at best. There is a huge dissonance created by the story being fairly realistic and the gameplay involving you gunning down dozens of npcs per mission. It feels weird, and just kind of has to be ignored.

Which is worth it, again, because of the story. But Rockstar's outdated game design prevents this game from being truly perfect.";50.1;1.0;0.0;159.0;Posted: May 19

The story has had a great impact on me in terms of appreciation for an amazing single player/ open world kind of game. The story itself has everything. Comedy/ sadness/ love/ appreciation for people close to you.

The combat is really nice, with the use of Dead eye you can make the most crazy things happen. The wildest shots you can imagine in the wild west. The challenges to complete are freaking fun to do, treasure hunts in the fields, getting hunted by Pinkertons, encountering exotic animals and making the craziest looking outfits. What more do you need?

This game changed a lot for me, for real. It just takes you to another freaking world and making you realize how much of a rat someone can actually be. Yes, I'm looking at you, Micah. It hits you right in the feels.

This game's a solid 9/10, probably one of the best games I have ever played so far. And it's a true recommendation for anyone who enjoys a solid single player/ open world. I am so happy I was able to 100% the story. Since every minute was so freaking enjoyable.

Graphics are stellar. Story line is non-existent and very weak. The prior versions were far better with story line. This on e is missing what made the other RDR grat. BORING: Ride around on your steed and find things to do. Mission or story line is so poor, I was lost in what to do. Expect to tire of it quickly. Worth buying at a good deal just for graphics.

Red Dead Redemption 2 may be the greatest game to ever exist. The story, the beautiful massive world, amazing score, the characters, the writing, and most of all its protagonist Arthur Morgan who may go down as the best video game character ever. Roger Clark's performance is incredible. I could go days writing this review of me praising this game in every aspect, I'll just keep it relatively short. RDR 2 is an epic masterpiece that proves video games are high art. Everyone should experience this game and the journey it gives you. The world and its characters will suck you in.

BUY THIS GAME! I'll tell you why:
1. Level of detail. Within' this game the level of detail that portrays across the entire game is amazing. Every single animal has it's own role and life. For instance, eagles swoop and kill prey, coyote's kill in packs and socialise, rams fight for mating rights by clashing their horns, birds coordinate together and fly with one another and so much more. Every animal is capable of something and that's amazing. The landscape, everything moves, 90% of everything is interactive, it's like nothing I've ever seen.

2. The Storyline. The story is truly amazing and lasts more than 80 hours upon full completion, I'll not ruin it, but I will say you'll never regret learning the story of the main characters! One thing I love is there's no rush, you never have to instantly do a quest unless you started one already, you can relax whilst in story mode and make your own path, story can always be secondary.

3. Gamemodes. I'm very glad that not only can you play a single player storyline with a full fledged amazing story, but you can also play online with all your friends with a whole different story!

4. Your decisions matter. Unlike other games, your decisions can actually matter depending on the quest, which I find really cool, you can decide if you want to try keep a good reputation or a bad one, stealing or helping, etc.

5. No Harsh Death. In the game, when you die, you'll mostly just lose whatever is on your horses back which is very helpful and it takes stress off of you if you're carrying valuable items and die in storyline.

6. Keep Coming Back. I can't stop playing the game, every time I log on I have tons and tons to do and I never end up getting bored, I play all day for hours on end on storyline and if I ever get bored of it, there's a whole other world in online mode!

7. Variety. There are roughly 60 horse coats and patterns for you to find as well as 19 horse breeds in total! Whatever your riding vibe is, you'll find your match. There are around 200 different species of animals to hunt and observe, each with their own life and their extremely high-tech coding means they do everything naturally. Sometimes it's so amazing, I saw two wolf packs standing off, muskrat and beavers along side each other like in reality, dams, so much more. And TONS of items, craftables, etc.

8. Overall. This has only been a TINY bit of the world in Red Dead Redemption 2. The amount of worlds and the HUGE MAP is amazing. This game deserves all it's credit, and all my appreciation. 100% buy this if you have the chance, it's a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it. I couldn't price it any less, it's so amazing.

9. Rivals. The game that will most likely rival RD2 is either Microsoft Flight 2020 or Forza 5. Each have their own unique beautiful game graphics and mechanics. I think RD2 is above them, because of the amount of detail it possesses.

8. Dislike. The only thing I dislike about this game is that in online mode you can't make a solo session. Which is odd considering Rock Star made a solo session option for GTA 5 but not this. It may happen, who knows.

I hope you found this helpful!";100.2;1.0;0.0;44.0;Posted: May 18

This game is a true masterpiece, and I know a lot of people who agree. Even though the game started off slowly, it quickly drew me into the plot in the second chapter.

Now, I've played a lot of video games in my time, but nothing, and I mean nothing, compares to this; I'd give my left limb to have this experience all over again.

world is vivid and feels so real. you can do plenty of things there. this is a pro.

problem is, i do not like its story. i do not agree with arthur on many things. so i can not fit in when i roleplay. i am paragon and do not wanna be a villain. but when arthur beat an innocent people when i wanted to leave by riding a horse but somehow i triggered cutscene of me beating the innocent man, this sucks.
as a player i feel i do not have freedom to decide when i can finish the quest and how i can finish it.
also you do not have manuel save/load. because you do not have that freedom neither. congrats because you just have to start a new game to redone what you have done.
can you not save mike? no. can you avoid strawberry massacre? also no. so yea you totally have no freedom.
and oh, btw, arthur you beat a dying man in front of his wife and his kids. shame on you, thug.

Imagine one of the better Telltale games. Their first Walking Dead maybe, or perhaps Wolf Among Us. Now imagine that instead of being able to control all of the interesting choices you only controlled the walking around parts in-between. Then imagine the controls for those walking around parts were god-awful.

If you want an ""on the range life"" simulator game then this is probably great for you. Otherwise the controls are sluggish, restrictive, and automated in a way that will screw you over multiple times. Regardless of your inputs the game has layers of automation that will change what you're doing: make you slower, make you jump when you don't want, change your loadout, or kill your horse. The story is fine but it's no better than any old spaghetti western that already exists, except this is extraordinarily ham-handed. Every mission, every cutscene, is extravagently and self-indulgently drawn out to absurd lengths for the content on display.

Then to top it all it's still ridiculously buggy. My personal favorite bug came when I encountered a woman being kidnapped. I shot the kidnapper off of his horse, causing the woman to fall. The process of the fall apparently caused the game to re-classify her as a witness to her kidnappers murder. This made me wanted for murder. I then went to free the woman. The act of freeing her caused the game to add me to the, now empty, role of kidnapper. This made me wanted for kidnapping. But not all of the bugs are grand and entertaining, most are just small and frustrating.

From what I can tell this game earned a good reputation as an ""on the range life"" simulator with good graphics. I cannot see how anyone could enjoy any other part of this mess.";30.2;0.0;0.0;167.0;Posted: May 23

First of all, my bad rating is NOT about the game since it's an absolute masterpiece; my rating is to Rockstar directly.

I was playing this game and enjoying every minute of it, until I had the bright idea to get and install GTAV. Boy was that a BAAAAAAD idea! Thing was, the Rockstar launcher stopped connecting all of a sudden. Funny thing was, I closed RDR2 to play GTAV, since it didn't work, I tried to go back to RDR2 but it just wouldn't let me, even though I had just closed it 10 minutes ago. I tried EVERYTHING! Even the Social Club webpage wouldn't load. Then I noticed there are complaints about the same thing as far back as 2016 until this day.

Just like the first one this game is insane and definitely worth full price. I am so hyped for what the devs give us next - whatever it is, I hope for some elements from both games to make a return.

Tried out as many things as I could in this game, however the story progressed really quickly, which made many of the insane moments this game delivers totally missable, so don't rush when playing ;3";36.0;1.0;0.0;100.0;Posted: May 22

The game is great, however,
I found the 1st game much more scary. I remember quite fondly of the time i was in the more tropical parts of 4546B, praying to god they don't catch me and in this game you just don't quite get the same feeling. Secondly I think that the first game felt a bit more...personal, like it was me that was doing things, like it was me that was me experiencing these events, while in below zero I felt like it was a character who already had a story and goals, and I wasn't finding new goals for myself and I wasn't creating my own story . Also, while I'm here I need to say that the theme of isolation was much better done in subnautica, there, my thoughts where only my own, but here, robin saying stuff just breaks the isolation to me, though I didn't mind anyone else talking. Still on the topic of a personal experience, in this game your alien friend Al-An tells you where to go, and while yes, the first game had distress signals that were also telling you where to go, you always explored a bit further because you wanted to know what lies in the unknown and that way you made your own little personal discoveries. However I must say they made the game really gorgeous and fixed a lot of annoying bugs and the quality of life is far better. I especially like the new air bladder. The prawn suit feels much more powerful and epic. I was really mad when I heard the voice actor for the PDA, but she grew on me. The jump jet isnt useless on land anymore and I can now literally fly with the grappling hook, is really fun. I love Al-An
And I was sooooo stoked when I heard margeruit's voice and damn that exosuit was so cool. All the characters feel like real people, the voice actors did an amazing job, but man was I sad when I saw the name of the last achievement. This game cannot be rated because I think it is different for everyone, but in my personal opinion you should buy it.
TL;DR: All praise Margeruit
P.S. I feel the need to say how cool everything about Margeruit is again.";30.1;1.0;0.0;37.0;Posted: May 17

I have a ton of hours logged to the first game and I am enjoying this one so far. Understand that this title is slightly different than the original. The silent protagonist aspect is no longer present. You have a character she has a name, she has a story and she is on a mission. Yes you can still explore and build till your hearts content but go into this one understanding that there is an overall goal at play and it is to find out what happen ed to her sister.

As most of the other reviews have stated, Below Zero fails to live up to the high quality of the original. The story is less interesting (with the exception if your alien passenger), the atmosphere is all but absent, the world is more linear and more empty at the same time, and the game is more messy as a result. Is it a bad game? Absolutely not, but the original is vastly superior in every way to the point there's no reason to play this one over the original in a scenario where you'd have to choose between the two. Worth it at half price or below, but certainly not at full price. It was supposed to be a DLC for the original and it shows. Buy it at DLC price, not full game price";25.1;1.0;0.0;783.0;Posted: May 19

Game's alright, shorter than the original, but much of the same.
Has slightly better controls, at least on land, but most of the glitches still exist from the first game so don't be too surprised if you see a monster stuck in the ground.
A lot of stuff was obviously cut or not well thought out, but it's still worth a shot, especially on sale.

This game was pretty ""cool"". Gave me ""chills"". Had a great time with this game. However if you want a more scary underwater experience like the first game, this is a severe downgrade.

The weird thing is that I still prefer this game over the original, but I can understand if some were disappointed with the game.

definitely not as good as the first one. half of the map is on land, but the movement physics and creature mechanics there are lackluster and often annoying. since half of the map is on land it means theres less content in sea. they shouldve focused all of their efforts on the underwater part because the underwater biomes are not as good compared to the ones in first game and often look murky, barren and boring. despite all of this its still a subnautica game and you will get your fair share of clutch moments with local fauna. the tapeworm infested crystal caves were actually pretty amusing";22.1;1.0;0.0;254.0;Posted: May 22

It is still just like the old Subnautica, with the exception of playing the role of a less anonymous character. Only this time it's a lot smoother. I wish they had of finished the original as well. The map I had heard was much smaller but I have found it petty big enough with surprisingly easy to get lost in above sea areas. I like how you are guided around the map better in this one, although you are babied some what and a lot of the objectives are easy to reach straight off. I had also been concerned about the new Truck, but it isn't much different from the sea moth, at the start. At least it doesn't get pinched and dumped under ground in this one.

My only real criticism is they could have changed the environment under the water a bit more. As to me the icy cold exterior doesn't marry as well with the vegetation from the original game. Why change the PDA voice and what is with all the female characters, that are hard to find any appeal with. The story is ok so far, but is not progressing much and seems like a remake of the original. the dangers from different life forms is very weak and you've got more chance of drowning, than having much of a problem with most of the sea life. It could have been better but I view it as more of a remake than progression. So it's good for those that haven't played the original or people that needed guides to find silver lol.";51.6;1.0;0.0;94.0;Posted: May 17

Below zero is obviously the sequel to Subnautica but it has a very different fell to the first game. It is a lot more story based and more colourful with less of a sense of being alone. It isn't bad it's just different in the gameplay
and feel. I really like lots of the additions to the mechanics and things i quite like. One of the things i felt was that it didn't have as clear of a progression as the first game but i think that's just me. It can occasionally have the feel of being like a test game but other times it is just as immersive as the original Subnautica. All in all a very good game and i highly recommend to play after the first game but don't expect it to be exactly the same as the first game.

Gameplay is generally satisfying and the game is worth playing. I do though think the twin story-line detracts from the game; a fuller story investigating the premise for the arrival on the planet and a similar 'escape style' ending as the original game would have been better. Conclusion is weak and I feel the secondary story was unnecessary if the other had been handled better.

Secondary Story would have been better served as a trilogy entry allowing for a more satisfying ending.";206.5;1.0;0.0;291.0;Posted: May 21

I'm honestly not sure how they did it.

The first Subnautica game was easily the best open world crafting game I've ever played, surely there was no way that they could create an experience even remotely as mind blowing a second time once the novelty of the original idea had already been experienced... right?

The environments, the base building, the new items, the music, the sound design of the creatures and what information small sounds in the environment could tell you, land mechanics, THE STORY... they have once again managed to create the perfect free form story-based crafting experience. At the end of the day, I have to call this series an experience, art and design in their purest forms even!

If I had to find one fault in this game and its predecessor, it would be that the game is almost TOO immersive an experience. I've gone from self-assigned task to task between story objectives and found myself lose hours of time in what felt like minutes... and yet every second of it was well worth it, and my lack of time is in no way a fault of the game.

If you like the first game, play this game. If you've yet to experience the first game.... go play it first. There are some small plot points that will hit differently if you played it first.

10/10, a game and series I think everyone needs to experience at least once, especially if they're terrified of the ocean like I am!";33.1;1.0;0.0;209.0;Posted: May 19

One of my favorite games. As a teenager I designed a similar ""wish game"" in a booklet to develop it at some point (never happened). So I'm glad you guys from Unknown Worlds Entertainment exist and did it.

Basically I have nothing negative to say about this game except that I miss a multiplayer mode. It would also be enough if it was only in the local network and not online.

Definitely great game with a lot of emotions and adrenaline. What you would most like is that it never stops and that there is an endless amount to discover. So I really hope for extensions and new things from you!

If you liked the first game chances are you'll like this too. The open ocean has been broken up by icebergs and fragmented into caves underground, and land gameplay has been improved (a substantial portion of the game takes place on land).

Crafting, inventory management, and resource-gathering all remains virtually identical to the previous game, so it's familiar to returning players and simple enough for newcomers. Warning for old players looking for the same experience:

Base-building is still fun and there have been some improvements, however a mod is still required for snapping buildings and objects onto a grid system.

The story they try to tell falls a little flat, as I felt the best part of Subnautica was never the story but moreover the sense of loneliness and drive to explore.

Scariness? Subnautica had so many moments that had me jump in my seat but Below Zero's fauna really felt tame compared to the original. Frankly, the scariest part of the game is the desperation of searching for an oxygen plant while deep into a cave system.

Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first, and even if you spend full price these devs are working hard to make the third entry in the series even better than both before, and deserve our support

The deep sea is full of dangers, and you have no idea what kind of monsters are hidden in the dark water. However, the deeper you dive, the clearer you can hear the monster's terrible sound. You know you're not far from your goal, but you also perceive that monsters are getting closer to you. In a stunning underwater exploration, Subnautica: Below Zero Zero allows players to experience endless wonder and horror. Every diving adventure is filled with a spirit of exploration that stirs up your sense of self-preservation. When you get back to the water and breathe in the fresh air again, you'll feel accomplished, perhaps discovering a new mystery or finding a new opportunity to make your next diving adventure more meaningful.";4.5;1.0;0.0;15.0;Posted: May 22

I would recommend the original Subnautica over this any day if it's a choice between the two rather than getting the collection. Getting the collection on-sale (which is what I did, it was both games for ~the price of one off-sale) is a good bet though. Going with recommended just because my issues are kind of case-by-case.
+ Scanning and some other things are faster than og Subnautica
+ Multi-compartment sea transportation (Sea truck/sea bus)
+ Sea monkeys
+ There is something that you can pet (but be careful)
-/+ Holds your hand a lot more than og Subnautica
- No more cyclops = no more mobile base
- Can't pet the sea monkeys
- Fairly buggy still, incl. a bug which causes things to not load in front of you (there is a troubleshooting thread for this)";13.5;1.0;1.0;553.0;Posted: May 18

Excellent game! Forget about all the bad reviews from people who played the previous one, I can't understand why you would not enjoy Below Zero if you loved Subnautica, ALTHOUGH I would understand if you liked it LESS. Yes, Below Zero feels like a Subnautica 1.5 rather than a sequel, it feels even like a big DLC, a standalone expansion, but that is totally fine! Big map, lots of creatures, lots to explore and discover, it is still a very good game. I believe that if Below Zero got out as the only Subnautica ever, people would still have loved it and praised it! So yes, it is less good than the first one, and that was not very hard: Subnautica 1 is a masterpiece, it is the first one ever to do what it did, so it was hard to top that. Below Zero is definitely less mysterious, less gigantic, less aery, less creepy, with a less smart level design, yes it still has the clipping bugs here and there from the 1, yes most items, fishes, tools or recipes are the same... yes overall it is less good... so what? Is less good than a masterpiece bad? not enjoyable? Certainly not, I spent almost 50 hours exploring, building, and enjoying the scenario. And I personally LOVED the ending, I found it very generous and open towards expansion of the series. Now there are more dialogues, more characters, more cartoony action a bit reminiscent of modern RPGs like Bioshock or Outer Worlds, and we lost a bit of the mysterious poetry of the first one, but that is fine. The first one was indeed marvelous, I spent almost 150 hours on it, but I still REALLY enjoyed Below Zero, for its survival aspect (the temperature being a new factor), for its research which was pleasant (though the level design is more maze/corridors based), and its universe (still very cool to explore and enjoy). Sure it is just a bit more of the same, which is totally fine by me. If it is helping in waiting for Subnautica 2 (if ever), I was sold! If you loved the 1 and would like a good snack of the same taste, dive in!";46.5;1.0;0.0;1765.0;Posted: May 23

Shorter and smaller than the original, but kind of in a good way. everything feels a bit more dense.

The good:
Visually, this game is excellent, maybe better than the first one. The environments are phenomenal and most of the time are easy to navigate, giving a feeling of exploration rather than random travel.
The map is small enough that one centralized base is good enough for the whole game.
The story is straight forward and enjoyable to explore.
Decorations are abundant, if base customization is your thing.

The bad:
Some of my favorite tools are a little harder to find than in the original. The MC talks a bit too much for my liking. Weather on the surface is incredibly frustrating, not being able to navigate on land sucks, especially when the weather changes so fast.

Overall, 9/10";24.9;1.0;0.0;1307.0;Posted: May 18

A suitable follow up to Subnautica.

Good game, worth playing. Not as good as the first one, but it's hard to live up to the immaculate vibes of the first game- especially when you've already experienced the vibes before.

I wish the game would have done more to distinguish itself further from the first, maybe by leaning even further into the story aspect, but even just re-skinning the core game content would have done wonders to at least make you feel like you were doing something different from the first game. Too much just felt like a re-hash of things. I believe the original intention was for it to be a DLC for the first game, and it definitely shows. At least the core game content is already solid in the first place, so this doesn't feel too bad.

The game was definitely shorter (once again, makes sense if it was to be a DLC originally). Part of it was that I'm already a seasoned Subnautica veteran, so I sorta knew my limits and could progress more quickly than I otherwise would be able to, but the game itself was also smaller. Not a bad thing on its own- small games can leave huge impacts when done right- but I feel like they could have made this smaller package pack a bigger punch.

This point might just be me, but I found myself getting lost a lot more than in the first game. Not lost in a good way, like ""oh no I'm on an ocean planet and I wandered too far from my base and now I'm in the middle of nowhere and it's scary"", but more like ""okay I just did this story thing and now I have no idea what the game wants me to do next"". There were several occasions where I actually had to google what to do next, and I'm not the kind of guy who likes reading walkthroughs. The game is sometimes overly-cryptic on what it wants you to do, often vaguely referencing something in some voice line and hoping that you were listening and that you picked up on it and will then go and find whatever they were talking about. I'm all for not holding the player's hand too much and letting them figure things out for themselves, I love the sense of discovery and accomplishment from games who do this right, but things also have to be done in such a way that roadblocks are infrequent and surmountable.

Now that was a lot of criticising, but like I said it's still a good game, just not a very unique one. The first one had a certain magic to it that I felt was missing from this iteration in the franchise, but it was still an enjoyable experience all things considered. I would love to see another installment in the Subnautica universe someday, and I'm once again hoping that the devs embrace the fact that they likely won't be able to capture the exact same feeling of lonesome mystery of the first game, and instead work hard on other aspects of the game to really expand the story.";22.6;1.0;0.0;225.0;Posted: May 23

After finally finishing Subnautica I was excited to see the sequel. I've yet to finish Below Zero but the story and gameplay has been phenomenal. There are a few plot holes like how some fish have adapted to the cold environment of Planet 4546-B only 2 years later when it should take them 1 million years to adapt to 1°C. The terrain doesn't line up with Subnautica and either I haven't found them or the Degasi Habitats are absent. However, I think this is actually good since we get the opportunity to see new environments and creatures. So far the story has been compelling and it always leaves me curious for whats next. The creatures are very creative but the scare factor isn't there since I already got over the large creatures in the first game. The execution of the story has been great, it put me under conditions that gave the mystery of the game an ominous aura. The idea of the Seatruck was great and very creative, but it's a bit of a recycled idea from the cyclops in the first game. There's a lot more I could talk about but I don't want this review to get too long so I think I should stop here. Overall great game, but so far not as good as the first Subnautica.";130.0;1.0;0.0;57.0;Posted: May 21

Great game, so much fun, loved the implementation of the seatruck and all the compartments and Loved AL-AN. The only downside was when a pengling got glitched into my seatruck and i couldn't get it out so i had to make a new seatruck and i fell through the map too haha but that's ok. There was lot's of things they put into this one i liked like the robot pengling and i loved the story and talking with AL-AN.

Subnautica: Below Zero is a spin-off sequel to Subnautica, and like the first game its an open-world survival game with an ocean setting. You play as Robin Ayou, a biologist who travels to Planet 4546B to find more info about the death of her sister Sam. Despite taking place at the same planet as the first game, the region is different, and like the title, many locations are arctic-like, with big icebergs, frozen islands and all that.

The game looks and plays almost the same as the first one. You collect resources and craft items, while exploring points of interests and doing objectives. Most of the gear you have are the same, with some new additions. And for the sea creatures, almost all of them are different, the only exceptions being those small, edible fishes. However, the most notable change is the land biome. On some edges of the map, you have to explore the snowy islands. These are quite large compared to the islands in the first game. But worry not, for you can craft a land vehicle and a cold-resistant suit. Sadly, it seems that the game has less variations of sea biomes compared to the first one.

Story-wise, the game is quite shorter than the first one, around half of it, but involves more characters instead of you being alone. You can even find some audio logs from previous visitors with character portraits. Crafting is also somewhat less demanding, as you can finish the game with the basic Seatruck upgraded only with depth modules, the other vehicles and parts are optional. I'm not really a fan of hunting rare ingredients, especially in a game with no clear map and fast travel, so in a way it is kinda preferable.

While I like the stronger story and the involvement of more characters which makes the world feel alive, the sad thing is that many parts of the story can be skipped. While Robin's reason for being there is to investigate the death of her sister, it is treated like a sidequest, and you can actually escape the planet, finishing the game without even learning a bit about what happened to her if you don't explore the abandoned Alterra bases. I think it would be better if the game forces and leads us to those locations, maybe add beacon signals since they are kinda hard to find. For a game with an objective other than to escape, it just seems weird that it can be ignored and have the backstory progression mixed up, like how I found Sam's last log before her earlier ones.

In short, I think Subnautica: Below Zero is just as good as the first game, stronger in some parts yet weaker in others, but I kinda like this a bit more due to the appearance of more characters. If you already played the first game and enjoyed it, there's no reason to not play this game because it looks and plays almost the same, and you will already be familiar with the mechanics. If you're looking for exploration survival games with a beautiful artstyle, you should try the Subnautica games, but try the first one before this.";23.4;1.0;0.0;416.0;Posted: May 21

I understand the criticism. There are 4 plot threads and 3 are optional for game completion. There are no difficult achievements; I got 100% on one play-through. There are some points where there is nothing telling you where to go (screw you, ""pilot last known location""), and some things with no clues (looking at you, Architect Tissue).

The above-water exploration is miserable and I had to go back there WAY too many times.

I recommend getting a map mod and/or using an interactive map.

But overall, I'm glad I played this game. It answers some questions I had about the original game's setting, the stories (if you finish them) are mostly satisfying, and the ending made me happy. The submarine was a ton of fun to customize and use. The sea monkeys are charming, and I bred a huge colony of them around my base. (pro tip: make a base near the purple heat vents. It's the only one you'll need.)

Oh, and pro tip #2: head to the distress signal as soon as you see it. Otherwise you might miss some fun dialogue as you explore. Once you know who Alan is, you're good.

If you liked subnautica 1 then you'll like this one too. S2 is good, but it is more story driven than survival driven, so the experience is significantly different with virtually identical gameplay.

At no point did it ever become clear to me when I should have been using the hoverbike. It required late game materials to craft but is used in the sections that you explore early game and never really return to more than once. That aside, the seatruck is way more usable than the cyclops and the progression is great. Never really felt like the game slowed down because I didn't miss intractables that were necessary for progression like in S1. You could reasonably finish the story in 10 hours if you aren't prone to leaving areas before you've fully explored them, but the side quest lore dumps add another couple hours.";18.6;1.0;0.0;243.0;Posted: May 21

I really didn't care much for all the surface work and backstory of the other engineers and scientists, AL-AN was a fun story and a good way to wrap up the game but all the dialogue from the other characters seemed so empty and pointless.

All in all it was fun but not as mysterious and demanding as the first.

If you liked the core game play elements of the original Subnautica, you will likely enjoy this addition.
The game play loop of explore, gather, upgrade, build, repeat is much of the same with some new tweaks. And as mentioned earlier, if you liked this from the 1st, this will scratch that itch.

The story is a little weaker. Not bad, but some story element from the 1st game and glossed over or ignored in this story.

I would recommend buying the game when it's on sale. It is a good game. I wish the world was a bit bigger and deeper. I liked the surface cold hazard. As others have mentioned, the sister-main-questline was a bit anti-climatic and ended abruptly. There could have been more background to raise the stakes on that questline.

Some simple gameplay tweaks could also have helped. For example, I would have made the deepest biome unreachable by the seatruck. This would have forced you, like in the first game, to use the prawn suit - and the seatruck prawnsuit module. As it stands, I finished the game without even bothering to construct the prawn suit.

Another idea would have been to create a 'Survival+' mode that implements the need for sleep. Add a simple foldout bed to the drop-pod. This would have made the seatruck sleeper module much more useful. In general, the only seatruck module I used consistently was the storage module.

If you enjoyed the first Subnautica, this one isn't too bad. The story is pretty good, gives you a pretty clear goal throughout the game, and having NPC interactions is nice. The ending is actually pretty good, and leaves a lot of possibilities for them to pursue if they want on DLC or later games. Leviathans are really good as well. However, it feels like they lost a passion for the game halfway through, Another thing that I feel was a downgrade was the vehicle system. The Sea Truck is a cool idea and fairly practical, but it doesn't stand up the feel of the Cyclops. I feel they should have kept the original vehicles, and added the new ones, enhance rather than replace. Overall, a good game that any fan will enjoy, just be warned you may feel a bit let down at the vehicle situation.";68.3;1.0;0.0;199.0;Posted: May 19

first game had a better world. the large room, glass roofing, and seabus are all cool. but id rather pay to have those things in the base subnautica. the issue i take with Below Zero's world is that it doesn't seem to have as much space as its predecessor, both above and below ""ground"". fewer, and smaller caves, less depth to, and less square meters of ""surface"" terrain. the cold above sea level areas were tedious and underwhelming. id rather have a seamoth to the seabus most times. just lackluster to the normal Subnautica.";14.4;1.0;0.0;182.0;Posted: May 22

Before playing, I thought this basically Subnautica 2. After watching the ending scene, now it feels more like Subnautica DLC.

That being said, all the good things about the original apply here too. Beautiful (and pretty damn scary 50% of the time) underwater graphic, creative alien animals/plants, building your base and going from nothing to a 3-story mansion...and not super user friendly quest markers. Now I don't expect it to be like a step by step&baby level Ubisoft style quest marker, but considering the fact that the player is exploring an *alien planet* *underwater* most of the times (sometimes you don't even see a thing around you), you just get lost time to time. I had to google several times just to figure out where to go/what to find for pretty much all of the stories (Sam's, Margaret's, Al-an's).

Snowfox is cool but almost no useful when I need it the most, Seatruck is basically a slow heavy Seamoth. Didn't even finish making all the modules for seatruck this time.";26.4;1.0;0.0;42.0;Posted: May 23

Pros: Better story line than the original.
Great abundance of minerals and the search tool is a smart addition.
Audio: Great sound tracks in the jukebox. Wish I could put a speaker in my sea truck though.
You are not alone on the planet. So, interaction is a factor in pros.

Cons: Still has bugs. Like spending 22 hours in the game and then finding out when it loads
that you are frozen and cannot move. Online help doesn't work. Uninstall/ re-install doesn't help.
Verifying game files doesn't work. (All driver, etc. updates done.) Waste of my life level
disappointment.
Changing input device settings do not work either.
WAY more predators to mess with you.

Good game that builds upon some of the strengths of its predecessor, but doesnt really expand on the formula, and instead falls short in a number of ways. Still a fun game, 7/10 seems like a fitting grade.

There isnt really a need to go into details; This is a continuation of the first game, which was just better all around. So play Subnautica 1 first, which is a great game; if you just want a bit more of the same and dont mind the issues, like a somewhat incomplete and handholding story, its fine.";25.5;1.0;0.0;376.0;Posted: May 16

Not as good as the original, but just as awesome!

Pro's:
- Very cool if short story, it's about the architects! (man, I hope this story continues!)
- Some cool new things like:
- Jukebox with some pretty cool music
- Little RC robots
- Surface exploration
- Cold tech (instead of radiation I guess)
- Snow man!

Con's:
- Very little new content. A lot of assets have been recycled from the orignal game. Which is fine but:
- Some useless new things like:
- Hoverbike (this thing is crap and useless, you are better off using the prawnsuit as the hoverbike has nothing but drawback and no benefits. Also handles worse than de damn 90m Sea truck)
- Fur suit against the cold (completely useless, in order to make it you need to traverse the cold to get some ingerdients. By the time you make it you have already figured you can use the prawn to traverse land)
- Some useless old things like:
- Containment for breeding fish (what for?? by the time you can build containment you dont need the fish. Unlike the original game where there was at least one species that was worth breeding. In sub zero there is no species that produces anything useful other than food and water. For which you have superior alternatives by the time you can build a containment unit)
- Nuclear reactor, no need. Since there is no real need or insentive to build deep bases youll end up with just your main base which is at the surface. Even if you didnt build it on top of the geothermal vents (for more power) a few extra solar panels will keep your base going without needing to make or store (depleted) fuel rods for your nuclear reactor.
- Bio reactor (see above, no real need)

In short:
Though I love subnautica I was deeply dissapointed. The map is much smaller and I expected more from the surface exploration part of the game. Base building is mostly the same as in the original game but there is now even less insentive to build multiple bases. The map is simply so small it is not worth your time. The sea truck is a beatiful edition to this game Vs. the cyclops and it was needed too. The cyclops would not work on this far too small map.

There are however beautiful new biomes to explore, some heavily repurposed and redesigned assets though, but they remains breathtaking. The story is fun to go through and explore, as the game is suppose to be an exploration game. But there is essentially 0 replayability.

I hope Subnautica 3 does the opposite of this release. And instead comes with a vast, vast, vast ocean to travel accros to give more plausible sense of actual ocean life and some more clever ways to make outpost building more appealing. If you loved Subnautica as I do, you will certainly enjoy this game too. But as for the same thrill of novelty as in Subnautica, you can forget about that alas. I guess I had too high of an expectation. The game feels rushed and though technically is perfectly sound, content wise it feels rather unpolished.

I finished the game in well under 50 hours. And though it's clear Alterra is covering sh*t up, it's still not clear what EXACTLY happened out there. For one thing, there is no reason Alterra would abandon the entire project like that! And what happened to the rest of the team?";51.6;1.0;0.0;271.0;Posted: May 20

I've taken the opposite approach to this game compared to the original Subnautica. Before, I bought Subnautica in early access and absolutely spoiled everything about the game for myself. I loved the game and atmosphere so much that when any new information came out I would eat it up. For Below Zero, I purposely ignored it though out it's entire development, so I would go in completely blind. Now that I've played through it fully, I can say that there are obvious improvements, but overall, I would say that I enjoyed this game less than the first.

I would say that this game is better visually, in pacing and with quality of life improvements. Overall however, I find that this game has a lot less to offer. The map itself is noticeably smaller, and has a major issue. There are huge landmasses in this game that are an absolute slog to get through. When you're in the water, you can move freely and explore in all directions. It's very liberating and fun to do. In this game, there is less of that, AND you are forced to run around a boring white island for hours that has barely anything of interest. This is the worst part of the game. You feel very restricted, and even with a floating cycle upgrade, exploring the maze of caves just to find way too many materials to hold is so unsatisfying it ruins the game.

The music also lacks the fear inducing ambience the original had. It feels more generic.

As for the story, I feel the ambience and isolation that the first game was known so well for is lost due to kinda interesting characters that mostly overcrowd this game with unneeded exposition. Your companion is a little too generic and overdone, with the whole ""trying to understand humans thing."" Also your main character speaks all the time, which removes all feelings of being stranded. Some games work better with a silent protagonist, and Subnautica is one of them.
As for the positives, I really enjoyed the quality of life updates. Like the better crafting and the much needed PRAWN suit improvements. However, I still feel this game lacked a major piece of the originals atmosphere and mystery. I give it a 5/10, but I can still recommend it if you enjoyed the first and are wanting more.";27.9;1.0;2.0;60.0;Posted: 21 May

After completing 100% the game i just wanna say: ""This game is Glorious"". But one warning: DO NOT READ ANY DISCUSSION OF THIS GAME ON STEAM, because this game is a suprising story with suprising things to find and events. And i know you will not like the spoilers. The leviathans is way scarier and more dangerous than the first game, and its way more causing trauma, it is just like people got thalassophobia have to suffer. Jukebox is AWESOME, if you using the module call Afterburner will the rhythm of the music, it is really fit, i wish to have more and more and more music to listen while exploring under the sea, I MIGHT BE LOST BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHO I AM :))
I LOVE THIS GAME and this is my feeling when seeing Chelicerate:

Watching other reviews I was expending this to be a worse game than the original but I underestimated how bad it compares to the original.
It is not a terrible game by any means but it somehow managed to improve on things that either unimportant or that make the experience worse while keeping the core experience literally the same. It's like an expansion that makes the game worse.
So what stays the same:
- the game loop
- the story. some broad strokes change but in essence it stays the same.
- most of the resources.
- navigation
- survival elements (now you have to manage low temperatures as well. woweee)

what changes:
- Voice acting with varying quality. Did it need it? Not really
- The dialogues. The less said about these the better because they ruin the experience almost single-handedly.
- New recipes, pictures and useless items to craft. There is only one useful addition the Quantum container and that is pretty much taken from mods.
- New biomes and a couple of different creatures that fulfill pretty much the same roles as the originals.
- The ice worm which looks menacing but it's actually more dangerous to your vehicle than you.
- 2 new vehicles and one removed. The snow fox sounds cool but controls awful.

Aaaaand that is pretty much it. The ending is so bad it hurts while mechanically being the same slog as the original.

Downplayed everything that made the first one good. You know what a game about diving alone needs? Land exploration, talking protagonist with an agenda, characters and dialog. It feels like $10 expansion for the original and if treated as such it is not a bad game. Has interesting ideas, but cons outweigh the pros.

Opened up a map and beelined for the plot places and never returned.

This game made me sad. As a huge fan of the first one, I feel like everything's missing. The story wasn't good and yes I understand this game was supposed to be a DLC but released in 2021 and the first one came out in 2014. There's so many things that below zero improved on compared to subnautica ex: how the world works, you'll see animals hunt each other with different methods and blablabla and I was amazed by the level of detail on some aspects which proved to me that the team did put a lot of work into this but not enough. All the menacing monsters look the same with the same design, they even added the boxing crab that was removed from the first game. Subnautica is a game that's supposed to be scary af, the first one had terrible graphics but it can be explained with the budget, time of release and many other things but the feeling of being in an emptiness of water with a monster that can be heard a cross the map, the story. Yeah no game's perfect but subnautica was a masterpiece it deserved more hype then it did get but that's okay. Below zero focused on things that weren't necessary to add to the dept of the game but more to the level of detail and that's cool and all but what about the actual game? I played the beta 2 years ago and I was playing the game today, after 4.6 hours of playtime I realized they added ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nothing in 2 years. NOTHING?!!?!??! That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥, all I see is extra details but that's about it also I loved that the view was beautiful looking outside the water but 90% of the time there's a store or some ♥♥♥♥ and the effects are so poorly made that you just can't see and you go back to the water. As everyone said, every biom feels the same. There's no plot or something cool that you'll discover its just boring. BIG CONCERN: WHY WOULD THEY MAKE IT SO DAMN HARD TO START BUILDING?????? I hated this ♥♥♥♥, forced to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ water chests that hold nothing in them and ended up living in my water bus, why would you be restrained from building anything for 4+ hours? You're forced to go explore literally 75% of the game just to start building. No multiplayer? Seriously? in 2021, now 2022 y'all made a game that would be perfect in coop ♥♥♥ solo? It was bad enough with the first one being solo but 2014 yk yk. ITS 2021 FAMMM if your not making an open world that even has the mechanic to build underwater bases not coop is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid. Y'all literally missed out on an extra 35% profit just because coop wasn't your vibe ig.


TLDR: Good attention to detail, bad story, bad enemies, no sense of fear, no coop after 7 years, big enemies are ctrl c ctrl v and all worst than the ones that were made 7 years ago. They also made a very cool monster and decided to freeze him in some ice and call it a da.";4.9;0.0;2.0;49.0;Posted: May 16

I would give this game a neutral review, its ok and i like survival base building a lot especially when it comes with a mystery. But it fails to bring back any of the charm of the first game. In Subnautica you were stranded and the goeal was to get off the planet, the alien subplot was just part of your journey.

Now you come to the planet to find out what heppend to your sister and get an alien stuck in your head wich becomes the main plot. You dont have to find out any of the sister stuff to finish the game its maybe just for NPC feelings.

And what i really dislike about the game, its to bright. In subnautica you had to use sonar to navigat the dark caverns and it was moody and scary. Now there is glowing everywhere no matter how deep you go. In completely ruins the scary vibe. The monsters in the caverns are scary the first time you meet them but they almost do no damage to your vehicle wich doesnt even need to be fully upgraded to get to the lowest point.

Basically 10 hours in the game became an annoyence and i probaly wont replay it

Original Subnatica is one of my most favorite games of all times. It was appearent that the follow up game would have it difficult as succeding the original was a tough task.

I didnt manage to finish this game. At one point I just gave up and rather restarted original Subnatica. I will still buy Subnautica 3 when it comes out. But Subnautica: Bellow Zero is simply a downgrade story wise and gameplay wise over the original game.

Yes, there are some nice things. Graphic is bit better, the new vehicle that replaced Cyclops was kind of fun, although I miss my Cyclops. Some quality of life improvements were done. Not sure if all are for the better but generally yes.

The negative side is certainly the world or map whatever you call it. Its way more streamlined and limited exploration wise. I didnt enjoy the ground part much either.

The story and overall feeling of the game cannot be even compared with the original. Original game story was so simple (you crash, try to survive and escape) and yet so much better. The atmosphere of the first game is in different league. In my first gameplay of Subnautica I felt totally absorbed, I was stressed about unknown and dangers that might be there somewhere (Subnatica did excellent job creating a sense of danger where in reality was very little of it if you were focused).

Original Subnatica scores 10/10.

But only the special locations are a bit easier to find than in the first part.
The search and grind for resources and blueprints is still extremely annoying.
So annoying that the game is (like already the first SN) IMO only playable when using guides, maps and debug console cheats.
Which is of course dumb: I don't want to have to use cheats or read WIKIs to be able to play this game in a way that you actually make some progress in lets say a 2 hour session and not only have searched for gold and silver in that whole time...";24.2;0.0;0.0;77.0;Posted: May 17

I do not recommend this game. I have recommended the first one tentatively in the past because of the environment storytelling and open world exploration aspects (the soundtrack for the first game is dope AF as well), but warned against level of resource grind and god awful movement scheme for the vehicles. This game has less of that, is shorter as well, but ultimately has a number of flaws that are unacceptable for me.

Number one, the devs STILL don't know how to make a stable piece of software that doesn't crash every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10 minutes. This may be the first issue you encounter. I say may, because others have told me that they haven't experienced any problems, or very few at least. Yet others still have agreed with me that they can barely have a decent length game session. Save files can and do corrupt and back ups of your save need to be made to preserve any kind of progress.

Number two, is the utterly horrible design decision with the ice worms towards the end of the game. This part alone is what's brought me to abandon my playthrough of this game. Massive worms that can sense any and all movement on the surface of the ice fields that you must cross to advance the story. You CANNOT skip this. You are soft locked out of completing the game is you try to skip it. The mechanic of having to navigate the ice worms itself isn't the issue (think sand worms from Dune, because the devs certainly were). It's the implementation. They provide you with a thumper, a craftable device that you spike into the ground (kinda like what you see in Dune) to distract the ice worm. Only these thumpers have an 80 metre range and once you move beyond that range you are attacked by yet another ice worm. It is also possible to get stun locked. If you move, you're attacked. If you don't move you can't progress. This would be fine if the tools given to you to tackle this problem actually worked. But they don't. It is clearly possible to complete the game because others have, however it seems more a test of patience rather than ingenuity on the part of the player. Hard pass for me.

Number three, movement speed underwater has been lowered. What in the name of every deity ever conceived by humanity were the devs thinking? Smooth movement and a decent level of speed is ESSENTIAL for first person games. In the first game you would glide around effortlessly which made the underwater world exploration a joy to experience (when using the seaglide or the seamoth). Now you're slower and possibly there's more inertia. You get used to it, but it's still terrible.

Number four, the vehicles suck dog nads. The first game had the seamoth (a tiny submarine that was like a space ship which you can zip around in fluidly - 10/10); the prawn (a cumbersome mech that walked on the ocean floor and relied on jump jets and a grappling hook for scaling high areas - 7/10); and finally the cyclops (an impressive looking submarine that many people turned into a mobile base, but had god awful controls - 5/10) They all make sense within the context of the game despite my distaste for the last two. However, in this game you get the seatruck (a replacement for the seamoth AND cyclops that is a modular 'train') and the prawn. You know how I feel about the prawn (oh, and I barely got to use the damn thing). The seatruck... sigh... The cabin part is, well, it's fine. Just fine. It does what it says on the box, except you can't fit it in places that it looks like it should fit. The collision box is wonky at best and you'll find yourself clipping things ALL THE TIME. As you add more modules onto the cabin section you'll slow the vehicle down. Understandable, but SSSSSSLLLLLOOOOOWWWWW! Meaning, unless you can tolerate moving at a glacial pace, you'll be fine modding out your seatruck to your heart's content. But if you actually want to get ♥♥♥♥ done because, you know, you have a life to live, then good luck.

I've ordered my gripes in order of most unacceptable to least unacceptable. Honestly, it's not a bad game, but the constant crashing and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid design decisions surrounding the ice worms broke the game for me. I got it on sale for a little more than $20AUD and I got 20 hours of gameplay out of it, so there is that. But I was unable to complete the game. Make up your own minds about this one. I don't recommend it, but if you have the patience to get through it then perhaps it's for you.";20.7;0.0;0.0;287.0;Posted: May 21

Everything is worse than the original. I bought on sale and it was arguably worth it, but I found myself wanting to play the first one again about halfway through.

The story is cool enough but the writing is terrible. Dialogue feels canned and corny. There are characters who receive varying levels of development and I found myself most interested with the ones who had the least. I realized this was because I wanted want the original game offered - a sense of mystery.

And believe me, there is NO sense of mystery in this game. Each ""discovery"" is bookended with dialogue from two characters who, should by all accounts, be interesting... but they're not.

Vehicles are worse, environments are worse, map layout is WAY worse. in the original game I found myself quickly memorizing landmarks and shortcuts between biomes. In this game they simply don't exist. Virtually every sea cave is a walled garden. This makes navigating to specific resources overly tedious and betrays any feeling the environment you're exploring is organic.

Overall, if you loved the first game, and this is on sale, then buy. If you're torn between this and the original, go for Subnautica Classic.";33.3;0.0;2.0;181.0;Posted: 17 May

I have 4.6 hours (by the time of writing this) on this game, compared to Subnautica where I have 106.

This game fails to keep me interested due to a considerable lack of innovations to the core systems of the first installment. Sure, there's a brand new story, new biomes, new creatures, plants, etc., everything is new... but the scale is still somehow smaller than how the original Subnautica felt.

Submarines are, personally, quite lacking. The Sea Truck is, in my opinion, a disappointment on several levels. The lack of the original game's Seamoth and Cyclops makes exploring the game for new technologies feel less rewarding and it feels like you have less of a personal goal in this outside of the story, which seems to rush you toward a certain goal more than the last one did, which was extremely focused on freedom of pacing whereas this one just hammers the point over your head several times over and always forces you to remember ""Oh yeah, I need to do this"".
This isn't necessarily a wrong thing to do, it just feels like this game is a downgrade compared to the original Subnautica, and seeing how the developers, for some reason, seem to not only refuse but actively work against the community's wishes for bigger, more customizable submarines makes this an incredibly disappointing addition to the series. Some people might disagree, but that's just how I feel about it.

TL;DR, I enjoy what they did with the game on a visual standpoint, hands down it's much prettier than the original, but I can't help but feel like the actual game is more lacking in content than the original had and the focus on the story does more harm than good in my opinion.

Subnautica has always felt to me like an exploration game, first and foremost, with hidden lore that isn't blared out into your face unless you go looking/reading for it. The original game gave you multiple options for adventuring, what with the 3 different submarines that accomplished very different objectives, but the fact that, in this game, you only get a clunky hybrid of the seamoth and cyclops that is the Sea Truck and the Prawn Suit, which also feels a bit clunky in its own right when it comes to exploring, makes this game feel much more tedious not only when it comes to exploring, but the goal of exploring as a whole.

I'll probably finish this game for real one day, but in its present state it feels unenjoyable and like a downgrade from the original Subnautica. Go play that one instead.";4.6;0.0;1.0;229.0;Posted: May 20

This game relies on fear to create the idea of vastness. If you are not scared of the concepts in this game, it becomes small quickly. The storyline for AL-AN is concise, and the average player could complete the game in its entirety in less than 5 hours. Another gripe is that this is the SECOND time they have teased us with enormous leviathans. I'm sure I'm speaking for everyone when I say that people don't want to see out of commission leviathans and think, ""What could have been.""

This game isn't even close to as good as the first one. The biodiversity is practically non existent. I would say there are less then 10 unique species. The leviathans are boring. They are literally everywhere, and they are never an actually threat. The only thing you lose when they attack you is a minute of your time. This will happen constantly.

The maps are ugly and hard to explore. I had to use a YouTube video every step of the campaign, because everything is purposely hidden away. Remember, when the first game encouraged you to go forward? This game will only let you move forward if you find specific resources in remote hard to reach corners of the map, with no indication that they are their. Again, I had to use online guides for everything. If you want to progress the story you have to navigate the repetitive hallways filled with leviathans that hide were you are supposed to go or even any indication that you are going in the right direction.

The story is bland and progression is so hard to progress that I didn't really care by the end of it. Ex: One of the characters asks you to find them on an iceberg in a field of icebergs. The only hint is that they are around 1 km west of you. That doesn't limit you search at all, so you can spend an hour or two looking or just consult an online video.

Do not get this game unless it is on sale for $5. Soundtrack was dope though.";40.2;0.0;2.0;263.0;Posted: May 17

I would not recommend this because having completed five artefact locations and several building locations, nothing else is appearing. The story just seems to have stopped. Yet I have not finished by any means. Nothing is telling me what I need to do, nor where I need to go, no new location markers are appearing.

I have just spent five hours driving, walking and swimming around effectively not doing anything, not finding anything and am bored stupid. There is an alien presence in my head, that seems to tell you when you are near something of note, but has not spoken for those five hours.

In conclusion this seems to be the lamest open world game I have ever seen.

We Were Here Forever is a game that I wished time and time again would go on forever. The near constant yelling at my friend because he couldnt follow basic directions, or dejected apologies as I realize it was my fault this time. The times where I would anxiously scream for my friend to save me while he figures out which symbol I badly described, as an insurmountable threat loomed over me. truly the scariest thing in the world is having death itself stare into your eyes as one of your dullard accomplices figures out if mayonnaise is an instrument.

I want to leave a scathing review about how the game ended too early and that I wanted this and that to happen instead of the ending but that just speaks to how much I enjoyed the game. Total Mayhem Games made a game that did not go on forever, and that is a darn shame.

definitely one of the best editions to this franchise, and highly recommend if you got a buddy you want to play through it with, especially if you've played the last 3 titles.

pros: the co-op for these puzzles actually feel needed, sounds weird to put this here I know but my biggest grip with the last entry was this exact problem so figured it would be good to put it here. the other big grip of previous titles they fixed in this one is that the story actually feels like it happens throughout the whole run time, while in previous titles its felt like its all loaded into the last chapter

moving onto more generally notes, the puzzles all have fairly fun and unique ways of going about them, with 1 or 2 outliers that I'll talk about in the cons. the sound designs pretty great in this one as well as the visuals, with the story being fairly engaging.

cons: for starters the biggest con is those outlier puzzles I was talking about, there puzzles that end up over staying there welcome or just have frustrating design in the first place, which if me and my co-op partner hadn't already played through the previous titles probably would have left at them then other than that maybe could use with reorganization of puzzles as a few late game puzzles felt quite easy to have been so far into the games progression";12.6;1.0;0.0;250.0;Posted: May 23

Let me start by saying that this whole series has been a fantastic experience for me, one I won't ever forget. I can't recommend this series enough and wish to see more co-op puzzle games like these.

The atmosphere and design of this game were on point. You can see that a lot of effort has been put into that, which I appreciate enormously. It made everything even more immersive. The communication between you and your partner was vital and got pushed up a notch to solve certain puzzles (I won't go into details, I don't want to spoil). The puzzles were not too tricky and not that hard to solve either. Some of their visuals blew my mind.

I love how the two characters are together for most of the game. I felt a great sense of freedom due to it. In previous games, it was pretty set who had to solve which part of the puzzle. In 'Forever' it depends on who walked first or opened something first etc. I love the little breaks between the puzzles (where you had to travel from one place to the other). Those made it more immersive for me. The break allowed you to play rock, paper, scissors, talk about your environment or share ideas about what you think will happen next. Were the puzzles gave me a more dependent feeling on each other, the breaks gave me the sense that we were in this together as friends.

Therefore the end hit even harder than in the previous games... It gutted me.";15.5;1.0;0.0;50.0;Posted: May 22

We Were Here Forever is a great 2 player online co-op puzzle game that relies on communicating with your partner.

Best part of the series yet! The storytelling has been improved with cinematics. While there is an overarching story, this game works as a standalone because the focus on the story is about setting the mood for the next puzzle. The puzzles are less abstract, more intuitive and there are more of them. This doesn't mean they became easy, there will still be plenty of moments where you are stuck trying to figure out a puzzle, but they won't be as frustrating to solve. As usual, the puzzles work by exchanging information with each other and figuring them out with logic, some of which reset after a few attempts or by the timer running out.

The game currently has some issues that should be easily fixed. At the end of the octopus puzzle, I was still stuck in the chair while my partner could progress to the next puzzle. Loading up the save for the next puzzle gave a black screen to whoever was hosting. Luckily we could work around this by replaying the octopus puzzle because of the nice chapter select. In some of the bigger puzzles, the FPS takes a big hit, not just on my mediocre PC, but on my partner's beefy PC as well.

Overall, this is a fun time, it's more and better!

For achievement hunters:
Play the game from both sides and reach both endings, has a chapter select. If one of you has a weaker PC, make sure your partner is loaded in the game or you'll have to replay that part for the achievement to pop.";12.6;1.0;15.0;3141.0;Posted: 19 May

This game really does feel like a finale to the series, but it also feels like the beginning of something new.

I LOVED the chairlift part, it was spooky and exciting. They added rides to get to certain puzzles in this game and they are so fun. They also added back the satisfying music when we are done with a puzzle, it is the same music as the first game.

EDIT: After the most recent update my partner and I were able to finally finish the game. Was a great game, probably the best in the series so far. There were still bugs but nothing game breaking that had us not able to complete it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This sucks to write due to the fact that when the game works, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing.

BUT, it is basically unplayable in its current state. Spoiler warning ahead:

My partner and I have to play this in multiple sessions due to time constraints. This was working perfectly fine until we progressed to the graveyard level. Every time she tried to load into that level she would be met with a black screen. We tried all the fixes in the book and they did not work. This meant that we had to progress without saves. Seemed to be working fine, we finished the Graveyard section and placed the part in the.. gun? We then progressed to the Kraken puzzle. We ended the session there and then started again the next day. Once completing the Kraken puzzle I was locked in the room and we were unable to progress as the doors to the control room shut too fast. We restarted and then the levers to finish the Kraken level did not work. We restarted again. They worked that time and we progressed to the potion making. We finished the potion making and got the next part. Upon reaching the gun where the part goes in, we noticed that that part we previously had gotten from the graveyard level no longer existed. We then went back to the Graveyard level to try and complete it again and apon falling into the well, I was unable to pick up the pickaxe. Meaning we can not progress again. Not only that but the host is the only one who can hear sound effects on the graveyard level?

The puzzles are AMAZING and this is by far the best We Were Here game so far (I have played them all).. BUT.. it's basically unplayable in it's current state. We were fine with quickly re-playing the level but we are blocked again and again by bugs in the game hardlocking us into a restart.";16.3;1.0;0.0;608.0;Posted: May 16

TLDR: 9/10 - Masterpiece with a few bugs (All encountered bugs were resolved by restarting the game). Only real downside is that it is too short, I want more.

Came for team building and to get use of my superb communication and problem solving skills. Got a few massive strokes, cancer in my brain and a test of friendship. This game made me feel stupid and made me question whether I actually am capable of communicating with other people or if the world just accommodates my retardation. Would recommend.

I haven't actually finished the game yet, my friend and I just about hit the halfway mark. The two of us have played through all the previous games in the series together, and so far, this new entry has been a blast!

This entry has a wonderful balance so far of easy ""you do that so I can get over here, then ill pull this so you can get over as well"" puzzles, and difficult ""hold on a second while I draw this out"" puzzles. The game play is very similar to the previous games, but it is absolutely worth the price for the amount of hours of enjoyment we've gotten already.

tl;dr: More than worth the price, especially if you've already played the previous games and are hungry for more, make sure you bring a friend :)


note: The game was released only a few days ago as of writing, and we have run across our fair share of bugs and even one soft lock, but the devs have been really active in the discussion forms and I expect that over the next few weeks most common bugs will be cleaned out and I'm honestly not worried at all about it given the reputation this dev has built for itself.";8.1;1.0;0.0;252.0;Posted: May 17

Memorable and fulfilling, ""the only negative aspect of these games that they eventually end""

This game is fantastic IF you have someone lined up to play it with, who can sit and vocally work at it for 10-20 hours in total. If you are still looking for someone or are thinking of playing with randoms, don't bother. I would also recommend playing the previous games to get a feel for the game and some extra background on the story, but it's not necessary to have a good time with this one.

The puzzles are all enjoyable and varied, saying any more would spoil some elements. It is worth noting that there are some timed events, so be ready for that, I have seen complaints about this being unexpected in the discussion section.";13.5;1.0;0.0;442.0;Posted: May 20

This is a very good game which sadly is let down by some horrible design decisions. There are long sections of the game where there is nothing to do but walk from point A to point B, long unskippable cutscenes and the finale in my opinion falls flat in comparison to the rest of the game.

The rest of the game is very good though. I think this is not the best in the series but I did really enjoy this game aside from the problems I mentioned above. Still highly recommended.";13.5;1.0;0.0;656.0;Posted: May 22

the best one in the series, but there were some puzzles in this game that I was really just not a fan of. The difficulty in the puzzles varied a lot, and one of them literally made no sense at all and we just had to brute force the solution until we got through it. we could not even reverse engineer the solution once we had the answers, that's how bad that one was. maybe we were just dumb.

you should probably play the other three before you play this one tho";8.8;1.0;0.0;293.0;Posted: May 22

the homies were indeed there forever

after playing the other 3 We Were Here games, this one definitely had a lot more polish in its presentation and ambition in the amount of content included in the game, especially taking into account that replaying the game allows for (mostly) different perspectives and interactions with the various puzzles.

The only gripe I had with this entry of the series is how during some puzzles, one of the players merely provides information to their partner, while the other player is the only one actually interacting and solving the puzzle. It did make the game a bit boring at times having only the option to reexplain information and wait for the puzzle to be solved, an issue not present in any of the previous games iirc (both players used to almost always interact and contribute to the solving of their parts of a level to complete the puzzle)

Still, this game is a good entry in the series. The storytelling was compelling and the visuals/atmosphere were fantastic. Hope to see more :)";4.1;1.0;0.0;248.0;Posted: May 22

Game is fun and definitely a recommend for people new to this genre. Puzzles are fun and has a long playtime. Very well worth the money and time.

For people who have played all the games of this genre in the past, it's still be a strong recommend but I think you've find this quite meh as compared to other games.

somethings that I really like about this game:
- Nice variations with the puzzles. In the end, co-op puzzles are just me telling you the missing info you need and vice versa, but there's a nice variation to it.
- good level of cooperation required
- good asymmetry (good puzzle design overall)
- Incorporation of time limitations

Somethings that irks me with this game:
-game breaking bugs that my friend and I have to restart our games to fix. Like items missing, critical interactions that aren't there/happening, etc.
- puzzles were fun, but I totally lost track of the story. Story was forgettable and not captivating.
- Starting the game turns out to be part of the puzzle too. there were a lot of issues in the beginning setting up the lobby/session, syncing to steam cloud issues that we have to fix by restarting steam.
- game load time was very long for someone with an older PC too.
- the walkies were more of a hassle than a challenge so we used discord instead.";13.7;1.0;0.0;251.0;Posted: May 17

We Were Here Forever was an extremely fun game to play through but in comparison to the previous game in the series, I'm not sure it lived up to expectations.

Most of the puzzles were unique and fun to solve. Some of them required a decent amount of thinking while others you needed good team coordination/communication. There was one puzzle that we thought was troublesome. Maybe we're just stupid but we thought the clues provided weren't very clear. Also it was the first time we used the ""Hint"" feature in the game and they were literally the most useless things ever. One of them was ""try to use deduction if you don't know where to place these"". Yeah thanks for telling me a basic human problem solving skill.
Personally I found some of the puzzles kind of boring. It just felt for a few of them that 1 person didn't have much to do.

The story was decent. Just the same stuff that's been going on the past few games. It does go more into depth of what's happening but I didn't care much for it.

The biggest problem in the game for us was all the waiting. They make you ride on like a snow lift multiple times that takes a solid like 20-30 seconds for no reason except the 1 time there was a cut scene. There are other instances too where it just takes too long for the game to take you through a pointless ride.

The graphics were great and a step up from the previous game. Soundtrack was fine, didn't really stand out at all. I only encountered one bug where I couldn't see the images on the buttons I was pressing. Quick restart fixed it though.

The final puzzle of the game was super easy. I'm pretty sure this is the last game in the series and for a final puzzle that sucked. Nearly every other puzzle was more difficult than the final one and kinda disappointed.

Despite all the negatives, it was still an extremely fun game and I do think it's worth full price.";15.7;1.0;4.0;495.0;Posted: 20 May

Amazing game, definitely the best in the series. Love it when my partner can't communicate and tells me to look over ""there"" and the ""thingy"" which gives me absolutely no information to work with.

Unlike the previous game where I had to look up a guide a couple of times, all the puzzles in the game were solvable on our own. There were a couple of times where we got really stuck and thought that it was a bug and it turned out the only bug was in our brains.";11.3;1.0;0.0;82.0;Posted: May 17

Play with a friend. It's worth it with a friend. Just don't expect to have an easy time even if you do know how this game goes in puzzle solutions because the majority of the challenge is communication.

Can you communicate clearly and not die when it matters? Will you get stuck for hours because you have two different views of the same symbol? A good game once told me, it all comes down to determination... are you? Can you be? For a friend?";17.5;1.0;0.0;184.0;Posted: May 22

Surprisingly long game! We expected it to be as long as the other games were, but this was totally a positive surprise! The game had so many different puzzles and challenges that it really needed some time. Some parts were extremely challenging for us, so this game can test your friendship :D

There were some random FPS bugs and it bugged once, but the great checkpoint system saved us. Well engineered game!

Really well made game and series! The puzzles are challenging, the story keeps you coming back, and the design is very well done!

We only ran into only a few issues. Had reload when stuck on a ski lift and reload when couldn't see other player once. Also a bit of lag on new location load in, but we were also recording so that probably didn't help :P

Overall though, gameplay was relatively smooth :)

I would highly recommend this game and the other games in the series!

Be warned you may cry at parts of the stories

Totally didn't cry at the conclusion... *grabs tissues*

Absolute 10/10 for the entire series. I loved the simple mechanics that still allowed for really cryptic and interesting puzzles, which were really challenging, but all the clues were there, and it was really fun trying to communicate with my friend to solve everything. I also loved the vaguely creepy nature of the setting and the story. The fact that the overarching narrative was another puzzle for us to piece together all the way through was really clever, and really fun to collect the information on. Fantastic game, would recommend.";12.2;1.0;0.0;8.0;Posted: May 19

Amazing game and definetely worth playing, and especially if you like them tricky puzzles. This game offers a ton of fun with a friend or even with random peeps but not many play the previous in the series. Cool idea with the walkie-talkie but has some voice issues whereas the other player might not hear you well for half a minute and there's also a nasty bug at the graveyard but luckely should be fixed with a simple restart.

If you love the previous games you will totally admire this one. They have outdone themselves regarding visuals, puzzles and mind boggling solutions. Of course you can also play this if you havent played the previous installments but its suggested to understand the story a little more and maybe get a feeling for how these games are played.
Chefs kiss at the jester again and his voice actor. Just cant get enough of his cackles and giggles. He's clearly the best character of the series.

The only thing, that really makes me pull my hair are the bugs in its current state. If you run into the blackscreen/whitescreen bug at any time, you have to continue without the proper save function. Which means, if you reach chapter 4 and dont push through till the final, you might be stuck in a somewhat loop of having to repeat the puzzles every time you start up the game. There are also bugs where you get stuck and have to restart a chapter.

I honestly hope the devs will fix all of these issues before the bad reviews hit the games overall ""very positive"" review state.

Tl;dr

Amazing game if you have a friend you want to
Don't expect the game to take your hand tho. The solutions are there but aren't always as obvious.

If you like puzzles, escape rooms and a playtime of 10-16hours or more if you switch roles to get all achievements, then this is for you!";17.0;1.0;1.0;231.0;Posted: May 22

An amazing game and upgrade from the previous games in the series. Graphics and puzzles wise. There is a lot less confusion due to missing hints and it is much clearer what went wrong. That isn't to say there weren't moments when me and my friend got stuck, but the instances were far less frustrating than in the last games in the series.

As of our playthrough (finished 6 days after release), there are still a fair few moments with framerate lag. They aren't super frequent, or at least we didn't pay it much mind. For a person whose first game might be We Were Here Forever or isn't a huge fan of the series, they might be more annoying or frustrating.

I look forward to whatever Total Mayhem Games decides to make in the future.";9.0;1.0;0.0;120.0;Posted: May 19

Took 10 hours to complete with a friend. Definitely had to lean on each other's strengths in different areas. Puzzles were not overly hard where we completely stalled for long.

This was a good addition to the series - the story, mechanics and puzzles were all fantastic - but I found it to be rather buggier than the previous titles. Hitboxes to interact with levers/switches were very hit-and-miss, and we weren't able to actually finish the game because we had a game-breaking bug in the finale that prevented us from making the final decision. 8/10 would play again if the bugs were fixed.";10.7;1.0;0.0;235.0;Posted: May 16

This game, like those that came before it, was a phenomenal play, and the puzzles were just the right type of difficult for myself and my partner. The story was honestly beautiful and kept us both wanting to play more and more. The length of this one is much longer than the previous instalments, and this is literally only a good thing, more puzzles, more teamwork, more getting annoyed when your partner describes something poorly and then realising it's your fault and trying to play it cool... My only complaint would be that, at current, there are a good handful of crash-inducing, game-breaking bugs and sections that do lag a considerable amount for seemingly no reason. Do not let this discourage you from playing though, as restarting seems to always fix the bugs, and they usually occur during or right around cutscenes, which play right after autosaves, so not much progress is lost. I believe that in spite of the bugs, it is a wonderful game, and I strongly recommend it be played with trusted friends that you can truly communicate with, as it is best experienced with someone who understands you clearly. All in all, I will absolutely be playing through it again with my partner from 'the other side' just to experience it a second time, and hopefully a few bug patches should improve the performance!";15.1;1.0;0.0;81.0;Posted: May 19

Had a great time playing through the game with my wife! The puzzles were great and felt much more satisfying than the last game. Visuals have been upgrades and everything looks cohesive and pleasant. There is a particular vista in this game that got us both to just stop and stare for a bit!

A note that there is an auditory puzzle in this game. Though you may be able to work around it, it was difficult for me as someone who is hard of hearing. Thankfully my wife was able to hear the sound queues well enough for us to complete the puzzle.

For the fourth time I got to leave my friend behind to die, thank you Total Mayhem Games (She is salty but it was worth it!)

""We were here forever"" - yeah we sure were, as me and my partner's one collective braincell tried its best to get us through the puzzles. They were hard but satisfying those times we did manage to figure out both what to do and succeeding with it. A few times not even the hints were able to save us though and we had to look up the solution online, but other than that the puzzles were a fun step up from the previous games. Some felt familiar but were not repetitive, and the same can be said for the game overall. The co-op experience is more balanced than it's ever been and as fun as we'd hope it'd be.

At last, we did conquer even this game, despite it being played on an actual potato from my side (rest in peace dear computer, you did your best). Me and my friend were very excited for this title and ultimately, it was worth the wait.";16.5;1.0;0.0;27.0;Posted: May 22

One of my absolute favourite game series, awesome puzzles, inspiring visuals and great finale to an epic co-op puzzler. This game did not disappoint. I only wish I could play more, my friend and I stopped playing for a few days just so it wouldn't finish as fast.

If you're looking into this series, the first game is free and they only get better.
Can't wait for what Total Mayhem Games bring to the table next.

P.S.
Current version of the game (v1.0.22) is buggy in places and if you want a better experience would advise waiting for a patch or more before playing but, even playing with bugs, I'm still very happy with the game.";10.3;1.0;1.0;128.0;Posted: May 17

Fantastic game! Despite being the 4th entry, it's probably the best and is my favorite for sure.
Many more puzzles than expected; you definitely get your money's worth.

Compared to previous games, there's less time-sensitive puzzles or puzzles where you can die if you make mistakes.

A truly exceptional co-op puzzle/escape-room style game. The entire series is fantastic.

This game is a major step-up in quality of puzzles, story-telling, and environment compared to the first three, especially noticeable upon entering maybe the most amazing / mind-bending puzzle room I've ever witnessed.

One or two of the puzzles are noticeably worse quality / harder to follow than the rest, made worse when it felt to us that the puzzle had become bugged (maybe it hadn't, though) BUT the sheer quality of the remainder of the game is high enough that these few experiences aren't enough to tarnish my overall experience.

It's not the longest game, but from my experience with this genre of games this is definitely on the longer side, and each game in the series has been progressively longer; I would not call the length of this game a downside. For the price and given the usual length of this genre, the length is perfect.";10.6;1.0;0.0;570.0;Posted: May 22

Puzzles, story, music / SFX and graphics were all excellent and I had an absolute blast playing through this.

Best part of the series so far! Very fun and diversified puzzles without repetition. Every puzzle feels very well thought out, works nice and helps to explain the story. If you enjoyed a We Were Here Game before you will absolutely love this game.

Also works a lot better for colorblind people than older titles as there are no exclusive color puzzles. If color is used in a puzzle it is always matched with a shape or something similar.

In my playthrough we only encountered 2 small bugs were we had to restart the game, which is of course a bit annoying. But thankfully the game is almost exclusively about understanding and solving the puzzles, so even after resetting you will be back up to your progress in a few moments.";9.7;1.0;0.0;110.0;Posted: May 19
We Were Here Forever;"Posted: May 19
I would say this game is pretty good, but caveat that on a couple of things. One, I played this with a friend and we used Discord to communicate, which means I can't evaluate the matchmaking or in-game communication system. Two, it's May of 2022 and this game is still new and definitely has a lot of bugs. None of them were game-breaking for us on our playthrough, but we did have to restart the game once to clear a softlock and we ended up glitching the ending cutscene out pretty badly.

As a part of the We Were Here series, I'd say it's on par with the previous entry (We Were Here Together), but for different reasons. This game is visually more impressive and has a greater emphasis on story, and there's less consequences for, shall we say, taking your time in solving the puzzles. However, WWHT had the superior puzzles and more polished gameplay.

Recommend playing the other games in the We Were Here series first if you haven't already, and then picking up this game after it's been out for a few months and the developer has had a chance to patch some of the bugs.

Finally, Jack and Rose both could have fit on the dang door. Come on.";8.7;1.0;0.0;139.0;Posted: May 19

Almost as good as We Were Here Together, but still a great game. For the length of development between the previous game and this one I did not expect the technical issues and missing animations, though I hope these can be patched or added in. The puzzles are all very good, though the difficulty was not consistent throughout the stages. I would rank this below We Were Here Together overall but still an enjoyable co op experience.

Its a fun game to play with a partner or friend. I would recommend at least playing 'We Were Here Together' before this one but they also have 2 more before that. Its very interesting to see how far they have come since their first game in this series.

I wish this game had some better visual/mechanical updates since the last game but it seems like they mainly focused on the gameplay and left most of the mechanics from the previous one in. That isn't a terrible thing but its a little clunky is certain areas but nothing that will negatively impact gameplay.

EDIT: I also forgot to mention but I wish it had a bit longer play time, me and my partner finished it in about 12 hours. The previous game was around 9-10 for us so I was hoping for 15-20 range.

Basically if you liked 'We Were Here Together', you'll like this one.";12.0;1.0;0.0;76.0;Posted: May 22

Longest of the 4-game-long saga. Me and my friend had a couple preformance issues with frame drops, along with some clunky animations but nothing that ruins the immersion or the experience. Rather long for a co-op puzzle game, although not that difficult. The creativity of the puzzles were a lot of fun, so was the setting, and my buddy and I had. Of course I highly recommend playing it with a friend, I doubt you can get the same experience with a random. The story is finished at last in this installment, and ties the very loose ends of the last games together nicely in my opinion. 7.5/10 Worth the price, fun with a pal, would've loved harder puzzles.";11.2;1.0;0.0;73.0;Posted: May 19

I think this was a great game. I've read through some other reviews, and I agree with some of the downsides. There are some pointless time wasters(riding on the lift, walking through long random corridors) and a few of the puzzles feel as though one person has all the information/tasks and the other person is just chilling for a while thinking, 'I wish my partner would hurry up.' Ultimately though, I didn't notice those much because I was having a great time with the puzzles. There's a bunch of innovative weird solutions. The storyline was interesting, and more goal oriented than the other installations, where you are just trying to escape through a bizarrely circuitous route through the castle. Took me 16 hours to complete(probably a little slow) but I think that's a lot of puzzle solving time for the price. Worth full price in my opinion.";16.6;1.0;0.0;35.0;Posted: May 22

Really nice game!
One of the best puzzle games I played.
Nice graffics and mechanics. A little bit heavy in some parts even with medium quality graphics.
The story is good but the way that the things are explained is hard to undersatnd but I liked it and I think everyone will be immersed in the story.

I don't like spending money on games but as soon as We Were Here Forever got released I bought it, just instantly. Totally. Worth. IT! It's what you'd expect from the We Were Here series, it's got excellent level designs, the story is so good. If you played the other games from the WWH series you'll find here what you want from previous games. 10/10, will play it again! The emotions this franchise and this game gives you...

I have played the whole series with the same friend and played all previous parts multiple times with others. I love this game and I'll tell you why. (SPOILER FREE)

PRO'S
1) The mystery story telling is super great. You can read extra stuff laying around for extra lore, but you don't have to and it still will make sense to you.
2) Music and atmosphere is an amazing addition to the story and overal panicky mood while puzzling under time pressure or in spooky places.
3) The puzzles itself were unique and different from the previous games they have made, some more tricky then others and always having a focal point around communication!!! YAAY!
4) The differences between playing puzzles under pressure and not under pressure is really great and makes it so you're not constantly in panic mode.
5) A big improvement compared to the earlier games is that you meet up more often between puzzles and get to ""swap sides"" so to say. This means sometimes you can be more in the explaining (librarian) role and sometimes more in the executing (explorer) role.
6) In cut scenes you can actually look around and still talk to your friend in game!

CONS
1) Most puzzles aren't randomised or reset when you fail. This means that you now know exactly what to do on a next / new try. This makes it harder to replay the game with other friends (than the first one you've played it with). Note; there are some that do reset when you make mistakes, but in comparison their first game it was barely any of them.
2) If there is anything little else to complain about its the limited way of looking around during cut scenes. Sometimes I couldn't look at my friend, which was sad, but doesn't make me take off any points (as this is a newer feature already!).

Besides that, on current release there is a couple of levels that seem to have buggy talkie walkies (limited to certain level areas), but they are super quick on patches and fixes on bugs. So by the time I'm replaying this, I'm not expecting any problems at all.

So 9/10 would puzzle again. Would be 10/10 if it had a higher replay-ability for puzzle resets.";15.1;1.0;0.0;152.0;Posted: May 21

My review page.
Follow me on twitch![www.twitch.tv]

The gist of it:
We Were Here Forever the final(?) entry in the series has finally launched but is it as good as the previous ones? No, it's much better! It's a fantastic puzzle-focused coop game and we need more.

👍 The good parts:
+Level design and the environments.
+The puzzles ofc.
+Much better story-telling than previous ones.

👎The bad parts:
-Minor bugs that made us restart an entire chapter.
-Some puzzles like the final one were super easy.

If you played the previous ones, you know there's some story about a king and how he did some bad things and some jester but it never made much sense. Luckily the story finally becomes much more focused and clear as there are finally story cutscenes with dialogue and everything.

You are back at Castle Rock trying to go through the Jester and King's endless puzzles but this time something changes. You manage to escape and find yourselves outside the castle where you find the plans of some rebel families that stood up to the King. I won't spoil more but this time around it feels like there's some actual lore behind everything as well as a proper ending, well except for one minor thing which I did not like at the end. Don't think there was an alternative to it.

In any case, this is not some story that will blow your mind or make you emotional, the series was never about that, but I appreciated that they did gave us something better than previous games in this regard.

Story rating: 7.5/10

Just like the previous games, We Were Here Forever is a coop puzzle-focused adventure game where you and your partner have to progress through really tough puzzles in order to escape Castle Rock and its vicinities.

You'll have parts where you can switch back and forth puzzles with your partner which helps in figuring out certain puzzles but there are also parts where you are both stuck on your selected side and you'll have to coordinate via voice on how to advance forward.

Most puzzles will require you both to really think hard but there are a few such as the final one where they are extremely easy. The last puzzle was a bit disappointing, I was expecting something much more with an ompfh. Overall as I don't want to spoil you with what the game will throw at you in terms of puzzles, there are going to be some path-blocking ones, there's a cooking simulator one, and so many more. They are all unique and different from each other, not once will you get bored. There's also a hint system tho it's mostly useless as it only tells you how to start figuring out the puzzles which anyone with an average IQ will do.

Fun and tough game and I'm curious what the devs can cook up next, assuming they'll still do coop/puzzle games. It's a rare genre so more is always welcome. Perhaps something sci-fi next time such as Portal 2 coop?

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

Ah, voice acting, finally you won't have to look at weird cutscenes without a voice and surprisingly it's really well acted.

The soundtrack is great, no complaints here, and I loved that there was a music type of puzzle as well as one with figuring out words out of sounds. Really well done.

Other than that, the sound effects such as the atmospheric ones and whatever else are generally quite good, no complaints.

Audio rating: 8/10

I'll start with the bad real quick which were some bugs that forced us to restart an entire chapter but the devs said it had to do with servers so who knows. There were other minor ones as well but nothing worth talking about.

What's really impressive this time around is the scope of the levels and their design. Long gone are the days of small rooms with puzzles, this time around everything around you feels masterfully crafted like a huge metroidvania-like map filled with puzzles, minus the backtracking. The way the levels and the puzzles are placed and how they work well with each other is perfect. They outdid themselves and I can't wait for what they do next.

As for the game performance, it's a bit iffy at times, frames can drop even on a high-end pc to 50s but overall it runs smooth.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8/10

If you're a fan of the series then I don't have to tell you to go buy it and if you're new I suggest playing them all tho not mandatory since We Were Here Forever can be easily played even as your first game.";14.4;1.0;5.0;564.0;Posted: 21 May

We We Here: FFFF

4/5

+ *MOST* of the puzzles were improved over the previous game in that both players got to do stuff versus player1 reading a single book and player2 doing all of the work. Both could advance the puzzle

+ Otherwise all the rest of the real puzzles were fun except for the 1 musical organ bit because it felt incomplete without the 2nd menu-hint; we probably could have figured it out with more time but my mate couldn't unshackle his mind from his musical-background-brainwashing.

- No TORCH puzzle? Missed opportunity..

- one bug in the crypts required us to restart the lobby, the checkpoint teleported us to the correct spots because we 100%'d the puzzle but a door wouldn't open.

- This one IS longer but there was definitely too much fluff which didn't need to be included
-- ^ including the FINALE bit which was a big waste.. It wasn't a puzzle at all as much as just jogging around flipping a few switches

Overall a good ride but the ending was a biiit lack lustre. I thought this was the finale but there could very well be another sequel.";15.5;1.0;0.0;152.0;Posted: May 22

We Were Here Forever;"Posted: May 23
Me and my partner played the first 3 games together, and then realised the fourth one was releasing soon, we knew we had to get the completionist on the first three before smashing out this one. We were so pumped to get this game the second it came out, and how could we resist that juicy 10% off sale?

Now the game, I will not lie has been a buggy mess, and it was especially worse when there was no Australian servers for the first few days. However the devs were really onto it and fixed everything as soon as they could, I know my partner wasn't taking any of the ♥♥♥♥ the first few days but then we both realised something in our hearts. We are the smartest, and the funniest, and the best, and the only ones who should be together in such desperate measures.

The best part about smashing out a game so early is that there is no walkthrough, meaning that everything we did was legitty on our titties, which leads me to believe that our brain patterns have been altered, what if we are both genetically engineered to begin with?

I remember playing the first game several times and not knowing about how deep the lore actually went, but when my partner came along for the first time, the one I was destined to be with, I just knew that the one I had been waiting for had finally come, and I opened my eyes for the first time to see how good the lore actually is. As I write this review, I know my partner wants more of this, whether its part of the same series or not, as long as we keep getting more.

I have a bad feeling however that this is the last game of the We Were Here series, they say that all good things must come to an end, however I do know one thing is for sure. This door closes for me, but it has made way for another one to open, the path that I must walk with my partner. And I know that I definitely won't be treading off this path, no matter how long it is I will always stand by my partners side, this series has prepared us for the toughest obstacles that we can now face on our own.

I was asked several times by a few of my friends, ""Who is this mysterious partner you keep referring to? And why are they so perfect?"" Perhaps one day I may reveal this partner, however all I can say for now, is that my partner was a very unlikely one, and that I would have never foreseen being with them like this.

Just the thought of me and my partner having been through so much together, seeing each other leave one behind, as one of us turns our backs and keeps walking, getting separated and coming back to each other. I do know that if I was ever met with a choice similar to the series in the real world, I know what I would pick. But I would not think of them as the ""Worst Friend Forever"". After all, I was always first to get left behind or die each time, and I don't plan on changing the outcome.

All that matters to me is my partners happiness, but how can I make someone happy when they are faced with such a difficult choice? If the time ever comes, I hope that my partner will understand what I have done, and that everything I did was to make this special someone happy. I do know that our ups heavily outweigh our downs, and that is enough for me. I sleep easy at night knowing that the choices I have made for my partner will keep a smile on their face.

To think that in the little time I had with my partner, it feels like we have known each other for years, decades, centuries, hell even eons. There will always be a place in my heart for my partner, whether we drift apart in the future, or if we end up staying together. I know damn well that I prefer the latter of that sentence, but I will keep this up as a memory, so that I may never forget the amazing times I had with my partner. We will tell everyone indeed that We, Were, Here.

Per usual the we were here series delivers and in an increasingly big way. It's been awesome to see the evolution of these games in quality and content. Puzzles that require thought rather than just brute force attempts to complete, as well as an increasing amount of NPC interaction in ways that feel more bound to our experience have put this game above its predecessors. I can only hope that the team will continue to develop games similar in nature and grow from this point. Thank you for the amazing journey and quality fun.";23.7;1.0;0.0;188.0;Posted: May 16

Played through the whole series with one of my best friends. This is our favorite game in the series and the puzzles were no doubt much harder, but so fun and rewarding to get through. The story telling is immaculate and very charming- I really recommend playing through the other games before playing this one. Our favorite puzzle game to play together. Play the other ones first and then totally do this one. We got frustrated alot though ngl. It's a puzzle game so it is to be expected, and very mild glitches encountered when we first played early on.";19.4;1.0;0.0;41.0;Posted: May 21

One of the most fun and creative co-op games I've played. It's also a huge improvement on the previous games in the ""We Were Here""-series. The presentation really took a step up, with the soundtrack genuinely being so good I'll add it to my playlist. Story is also interesting and just kinda neat overall. Also some surprisingly hard puzzles, which again serve as really cool setpieces in the game visually.

I have done the entire series with the same friend, and we have been looking forward to the next game coming out, and this did not disappoint. A truly wonderful addition to the series and probably both of our favorites so far, it has more focus on needing to work together, where as in the previous games, we managed to simply ""luck"" our way into solving the puzzles. Where as here, we needed to plan ahead and think about what our next move should be.
Other than some minor glitches, which required reconnecting, it was a really fun 10 or so hours for us.

Would def recommend anyone to pick this up if you have someone you enjoy playing co-op with.";9.9;1.0;0.0;446.0;Posted: May 23

Overall, just disappointing. I won't call it bad - you've got your two player puzzling and it works - but for the final(?) game in the series, the one with the longest development time and the one with the highest price tag, it feels a big step backwards from its predecessors.

It's hard to nail down exactly why, but I think it feels too tame, as if they approached this one with the mindset of really making a commercial game (the original was a student project IIRC), and were worried of scaring away players. There's no tension of having to solve a puzzle before you die to some encroaching hazard (increasingly-panicked chatter on the walkie talkies that can't both receive and transmit at the same time was genuinely one of my favourite parts of the previous games), and the puzzles are so self-contained - no more running around trying to figure out what you should be doing, instead you're typically sealed in a small area with only the puzzle elements, leaving the experience feeling overly-curated. ""Here's the next puzzle, solve it using these parts,"" goes the game, ""I'll be waiting to escort you to the next puzzle.""

On top of that, the puzzles themselves feel worse than in the previous games. Too many of the puzzles have both players simultaneously interacting with the same elements, leading to most of them ending with one person figuring it out and dictating everything to the other player. They feel more like single-player puzzles where the second player only exists to physically enter their half of the solution and maybe answer specific questions about details you know are there but can't see the exact details of.
The few asymmetrical puzzles beyond that seem to blitz through the interesting asymmetrical puzzle solving and go straight to the execution. Rather than collaboratively working out a solution you tend to see what you're supposed to do straight away followed by however much time of just repeating information back and forth, or worse one player is left really bored as their half just has so much less to do.
Really, the asymmetrical part of the co-op puzzle solving was what made the series unique, and to see it stray away from that feels like they've squandered what made the games what they are.

The game's longer than the older ones. There's more story as well, which may be hit-or-miss. I couldn't care less for it as it was the series's mechanics that held my interest, but the friend I played through them with was interested in the story. Either way, the individual puzzle quality has suffered for both. There were a couple I came out of thinking 'that one was pretty decent', but there's nothing memorable in there.

As I said at the start, I can't outright call it bad, but the development time and the price point both set expectations that the game consistently failed to meet. For half the price I likely would have been satisfied with the experience, but at full price it's just too bland.";11.5;0.0;17.0;276.0;Posted: 18 May

Not recommended. Very buggy, got soft locked multiple times. Most of the playtime was spent either running between 'puzzles' in long unneeded areas or redoing puzzles because they bugged out and soft-locked the game.

Managed to soldier through it just because at that point it was kind of funny how many bugs we could encounter and something else always managed to go wrong when trying to redo a stage. Honestly, contemplated a refund multiple times, but got the end, which was kind of abrupt itself.

The puzzles themselves are incredibly easy, most of them are not even puzzles, but just following instructions or mind-numbingly flipping lever.

I'd wait a year or so until bugs are ironed out and then I guess it would be worth it just for a casual co-op experience, but for a puzzle game, I'd look elsewhere.";12.8;0.0;2.0;715.0;Posted: May 19

This game just isn't as good as the others. A lot of the puzzles seem to just be one sided, where Player A reads info and Player B does everything.

My friend and I love we were here and we were here together, but this game falls short for us. We experienced almost no bugs (besides the ski-lift) and still didn't enjoy our time. The puzzles feel like they're either 1 guy with all the info, or both players with all the info, instead of an even split that would support communication like with other games in the series. Also can't stand how slowly the game gets at some points, especially the slow long treks back and forth between areas.";8.2;0.0;22.0;54.0;Posted: 16 May

TL;DR: I wouldn't recommend buying the game currently because there are (at least in our case maybe we just unlucky idk) gamebreaking bugs related to losing saves and progress which is very frustrating.....

It would actually be a good game, if not the best of the We Were Here series, if it didn't have game-breaking bugs. At some point in the game you have to repair a machine where you need three parts that you get in three different levels. But every time we finished a level and got a machine part, the previous machine parts were reset. After we had the second machine part, the first machine part was reset, so we did both levl again. Then we got the third machine part and the other machine parts were gone again now we have to do all lvl all over again and they are not short.We tried reloadig our savegames etc. but nothing worked
Conclusion: It would be a very, very good game with very good and fun puzzles, we really had a great time...so far...I would not recommend to buy the game until the bugs are fixed, otherwise ur enjoyment on the game quickly turns into frustration.But who knows maybe we only unlucky.";12.1;0.0;0.0;170.0;Posted: May 17

O pior da franquia. Mesmo gostando dos puzzles, o jogo em si é todo bugado, parece que o jogo foi rushado de um jeito ridículo. O menu do jogo já é um lobby, dar load em um save é bugado, você consegue cair para fora do mapa e não tem nenhum tipo de respawn a não ser dar load. O que mostra que o jogo foi rushado é o personagem fazer animações em algumas interações enquanto em outras o personagem fica completamente parado (animações que acontecem o tempo todo no jogo, tipo girar uma manivela). O pior é o quanto DEMORA para você se locomover nesse jogo, invés do jogo mostrar você entrando em algum lugar, andar um pouquinho e dar um load pro final ele faz você andar lentamente o caminho quase TODO sendo que não faz diferença nenhuma.

Eu joguei todos os jogos da franquia com o mesmo amigo, gostamos de todos tirando esse. Eu me diverti fazendo os puzzles com meu amigo, mas o resto poderia ter sido muito melhor.";15.4;0.0;1.0;281.0;Posted: May 22

It's not great right now. The puzzles are lackluster compared to the last 3 games, and there are so many bugs. I got softlocked 4 times, and 2 of them were falling out of the world. My co-op didn't fair much better. It's hard to enjoy a game where every step you take, and ever button you press, you know you may have to restart because of a bug. Don't buy in it's current state.

I consider the gameplay to be good, some puzzles could use a little more info but overall good puzzle design. The reason for my negative review is how piss poor the optimization for such a simple game is.... no matter what graphical settings I chose I consistently had extreme frame drops/stutters. The game was nearly unplayable due to the issues and I wouldn't recommend playing the game unless you just really want to finish the series.

Edit: After completing the game I now recommend the game even less than before, the performance was even worse in some areas and a handful of puzzles had good ideas but overall had poor execution making them very difficult to solve without extra insight... Overall still don't recommend the game unless you just need to finish the series

The mechanics of the game are often clunky and hinder playing, many puzzles are entirely one-sided or just break for no visible reason, and most are so incredibly simple that I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this.

So you install this not-so-cheap game and get super hyped.

Not all the puzzles are balanced. Spent half the game describing symbols while the other person does almost everything/the majority of the puzzling. By this I mean that one person has all the info and the other person just follows orders blindly. There are super long walks and travelling cut-scenes for no reason. Definitely the longest but not the best game in the series (unsure why people are saying it is). There are also game breaking bugs that make you restart the entire section. You're able to fall off the game map into endless oblivion by jumping off one of the ski lifts. For people who enjoy more balanced and challenging cooperative puzzles this is not the game for you.";11.0;0.0;0.0;172.0;Posted: May 23

I am VERY conflicted on what to give this.

I'm not sure if we needed to redo puzzles to gather these pieces for some canon looking thing. There was chapter hopping (went from 2 to 4 to 5 then 3 where we might have been glitched, not to mention when we select the chapter to get back, we probably have to redo the others since each chapter had other percentages done. So our ""56%"" goes down to like 20%-30% when we need to go back to chapter 3).

Some of us had crashing issues too (don't spam your radio for the hell of it), we also ran into some bugs where one of us was glitched under a bridge and the other couldn't use a switch to move it since the person was ""on it"".

Fun to argue with your partner with and without guides when you need it, but feels like a glitchy mess right now... Maybe give it a few weeks, but I'm not revisiting this after 13 hours and still didn't finish it.";13.3;0.0;0.0;921.0;Posted: May 17

A very nice turn-based strategy game. Quite similar format to a well-known Heroes of might and magic [HOMM] (for those who are familiar with the franchise) but also approach the genre with a different way which is very news and make the game exciting in its own.

The developers went with the idea of using less common fantasy as their own component of the game. Instead of a more common elf and dwarf, you get fays and frogmen. Very nice to see more fantasy stuff that is not already everywhere in the market.

And it comes with good old ""tavern"" style song!";54.9;1.0;0.0;155.0;Posted: May 20

Great game at first blush. Very similar to old Heroes of might and Magic, with a couple of interesting changes.

The magic system is really flexible and interesting, but I'm not sure if it's balanced (which isn't a big deal for me). The way to invest in it includes both your hero and your army, which is interesting.

The unit cap makes this more strategic and interesting and you won't necesserily want to build everything every game, which is also cool.";8.7;1.0;1.0;444.0;Posted: May 20

Game's great, and looks great.
And has a great level editor.
However, as great as the game is it's hard to recommend over the old games it was inspired by. The quality of content feels on par with the classics and the visuals and ui look much better but you don't get as much bang for you buck with this one. Heroes of Might and Magic 1-4 go for $10 usd each on GOG and often go on sale for even less, while I'm fine with this games price it's hard to recommend over HoMM3.
That said, if you've already played HoMM3 and want something new or you just don't like older games then this gets an easy recommend from me. The game is a great successor to the classics, it just struggles as a competitor to them.";12.4;1.0;5.0;883.0;Posted: May 16

The Chance for a new Adventure

TL,DR: Great Soundtrack and Pixel-graphics, interesting tactical combat, 2 campaigns 4 missions each, user generated content support at start with map maker, little to no bugs (I didn't have any besides soundtrack/sound turning off), multiplayer/hotseat/coop working. If you like turn based strategies (like HoMM series) give it a try.


While Songs of Conquest is starts as EA it has a lot of polish to it. Soundtrack, pixel graphics and overall athmosphere is quite nice and quality is really good. While a lot of fans of turn based strategies know Heroes of Might & Magic series ( and pretty much acknowledge HoMM3 as the best entry) will enjoy art style and setting, sometimes you will get a bit mad at how small some of the icons/ui elements are - sadly at this moment there is no UI scaling option, but overall maps and units are distinguishable and gorgeous.

Battles are quite fast, with classical mechanics like initiative, counter-attacks on melee hits and magic. Well known stacks (units) are somewhat limited, so no more 999+ ghost doomstacks roaming in multiplayer and destroying everyone. While normally in these type of games you would have 'mana' resource for your Hero (that casts spells) there is a twist in SoC - you gain mana passively for each turn from your hero's abillities and your stacks/units - every one of them has some specific mana type. All spells are unlocked from the start, so you can cast them in battle whenever you have corresponding mana type points - this means you can't start spellslinging in the 1st turn, which makes some of the more powerfull spells a later option.

At the moment there is only 2 campaigns, consisting of 4 missions with increasing difficulty - 2 more faction specific campaigns are in the works. After completing each mission you can hear the titular , which are pretty nice addition and summary of a mission. While these 8 missions will net you somewhere around 8hrs of gameplay, Devs thought about user created content - you can make/try out user made campaigns and maps by yourself. Also multiplayer is available, but sadly there is no simultaneous turns.

Overall:
- Beautifull artwork and soundtrack
- short 2 campaigns with 4 missions each BUT there is user created content already
- working multiplayer with experimental co-op
- quite nice map maker
- more tactical combat, with smaller stacks
- interesting magic, with no 'clearing'/nuke spells, but all available from the start
- NO UI scaling.
- few bugs - I encountered mostly soundtrack/sound related
- Devs are quite commited to this project and it feels like it will be cherished child of them";6.0;1.0;1.0;444.0;Posted: May 16

I came for a game like oldschool Homm, and I found so much more than I expected.

Being a solid and beautiful contestor in the genre right from early access, Songs of Conquest offers alot of innovative gameplay.

Unlike in other games of the genre, you are very flexible with your building paths, having the ability to build any building into different building slots (small, medium and large) which vary from settlement size and level. You can either go classic and go for every dwelling or decide to go hard into a certain troop.
Speaking about troops, there is an increase in strength for higher level troops but it is a slighter progression than you might be used to. There are caps on unitstacks, that can be upgraded, but also stop you from building doomstacks from the same unit very early on.

Troops also grant your heroe (wielder) essence (order, chaos, destruction, creation and arcana) from which they can produce powerful magic, some troops give just a bit, some give a lot and others do give few but multiple essences. Spells are chosen from a spellbook, you don't have to learn them. There are 4 spells per essence and 20 more that are combinations of 2 of them combined. So you are able to wield powerful magic from the get go.

There are multiple well made skirmish maps, 2 small campaigns and a map editor. And a great community to boot.";113.9;1.0;0.0;94.0;Posted: May 20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If i like the game ? I think it's the best HMM like ever even yet in early access (i've played all HMM except 1 and 2; fallen enchantress; age of wonders 2 and 3; warlock the exiled 2; disciple II; kings bounty II and maybe some i'm forgetting).

Why ? Nearly all new stuffs you add and change in the original formula are smart and full of potential. Stuff such as unit-based mana with 5 colors enabling many different combo and synergy; the fact that you start instant with all spells unlocked give you instantly the feeling of power and being an overpowered mage and make early game more enjoyable than in HMM.

I also appreciate the fact that there are fewer neutral fights on the map but more decisive, less homogeneous (less one monster type army or only one regrouped stack army) and more rewarding; and simply more free loot scattered across the map; all this makes the games more fluid and the fights against the neutrals less redundant.

Do i think it's a perfect game ? No, because :
There are problems intrinsic to games where the player has a lot of potential and where the AI must ""master complex game mechanics"".

After a few hours of games I had already found unbeatable low-cost strategies for each faction that allowed me to defeat armies much stronger than mine.
For example very quickly make dire dreaths, a single stack of this unit allowed to do almost all the fights of the map without the slightest loss (this is a little more difficult if the armies are composed of ranged units but the AI does not know how to use them I will come back to it later).
Another example make a lot of stack of 1 or 2 ancestral chelun and some stack max of shaman or Eth'dra, upgrade your hero level 3 in creation and arcane and spam spells of invocations of obstacles, teleportation, push, mists, swarms and arcane storms to totally block the opposing army, gain abundant mana and not lose any unit.
A last cheese to illustrate my words, ravagers and riders gain attack for each square traveled before attacking as with the cav of HMM however in this game we can make movements a square by a square without ending the turn, so that our ravager is not in the zone of control of an enemy, this one can go back and forth on 2 squares and then attack with a huge load bonus while it has technically almost not gained momentum before attacking.
This being just a few examples of cheese among the many find after a few hours of games.
The AI does not know how to use ranged units, they advance too far and too often before firing which drastically reduces its damage and exposes it to enemy melee units.

We can not increase the difficulty of the AIs neither in the campaign nor in skirmishes result I did not encounter any difficulty both in the skirmishes and in the campaign and this from my first hours of games (it should be noted that I very quickly overexploited some mechanics of the game and the poor intelligence of the AIs but if I do not I have the impression of underplaying and creating my own difficulty artificially) Beating the AI is currently without challenge for me (I don't lose any units in almost all the fights from the beginning of the game).

So I looked at multiplayer. However as you already know, you did not design the game for that, that's why you work on the simultaneous turn which is for me essential to be able to make games with more than 2 players (my last 4players FFA game lasts 8 hours to do only 20 rounds and I rushed to finish because I wanted to sleep).
I told myself that I had to play mainly in 1v1 but the lack of matchmaking puts me off because I am afraid of finding too little challenge or a risky challenge sometimes falling on a player with 10 times more hours of play than me. (logical you didn't expect so many players and multiplayer demands) We can try to determine our level of mutual play before facing each other in order to avoid this kind of problem but it loses its fluidity to find balanced games.

To conclude, this game is a pearl full of potential and this especially in view of your means. However, some flaws can hurt more demanding and experienced players, but can you be thrown the stone when none 4X should I say no turn-based tactical/strategic game solves either the problem of artificial intelligence by making it challenging, fun and quite predictable or the challenge of multiplayer (Almost all games of this genre have a very low multiplayer player base, no matchmaking, too long games and balance problems)?

Yes, all these challenges are still relevant and far from being overcome, but talented and adventurous small studios like yours are taking a big step in the right direction. So for all these reasons thank you! Thank you for your efforts, for the time you take to communicate with your players, for the attention to detail, for your ability to accept criticism and for your passion far too rare in this profession pollute by the video game industry and the thirst for profits at all costs. You still have a lot to do, so courage! And when you start to lose motivation in the face of the challenges ahead, think of the players like me who notice every detail, every choice, every intention to do better, every change and are grateful for it.";64.6;1.0;0.0;44.0;Posted: May 20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's very rare for a game that's a ""spiritual successor"" to a childhood favorite to live up to that expectation. Often those sorts only seek to copy a formula instead of building upon it, repeating design mistakes the original may have had, and ultimately ending up inferior to the original.

Songs of Conquest not that. Goodness gracious is it anything but that.

This game is a brilliant continuation of the Heroes formula, to a point that I almost want to consider it separately from those games, injecting new ideas into a tried and true formula while discarding outdated mechanics. The pixel-art is gorgeous, the music is incredible, and the basic skirmishes have perfectly captured that same hot-seat co-op fun I grew up with in Heroes 3.

I want to highlight some things about the the combat and magic system here, because I'm seeing in many reviews that people are calling it shallow, or lacking impact, being generally down on many of the systems. This is ABSOLUTELY not true, but I understand many of the complaints. People are trying to approach this as if they're just playing another version of Heroes of Might and Magic. That is a mistake, Songs of Conquest has a different flow than what's came before, and you will not experience it at its best if you don't adapt to it.

First off, the magic system. Songs of Conquest does away with spell points in favor of a Magic the Gathering sort of mana system. There are 5 different schools of magic, each tailored around a specific theme of magic. Order magic primarily revolves around buffs, Arcane gives some fun board manipulation spells, things like that. Each unit in the game is connected to at least one of these schools of magic, giving at least one orb (Basically a spell point) of that school every time they take a turn. The more orbs you have of a school, the more powerful magic you can cast of that school. In addition to that, there's many skills heroes can learn, as well as artifacts to find, that generate additional orbs and boost the power of spells in many different ways.

And at first, this does feel a little lackluster, combat spells barely tickling opponents and buffs being barely noticeable. Add to that that spell generation feels far too slow, and you'll be left barely remembering to use spells!

But then you start working *with* those mechanics. While the spells feel lackluster at first, they grow EXTREMELY powerful once you start gaining hero skills related to them. Movement spells like dimension door increase in range, eventually hitting a point where you can instantly dive a backline with slow, hard hitting melee units and delete ranged units before they ever get the chance to fire. A 'pacify' debuff doesn't feel all that great when it only lowers an enemies damage by 25%, but after taking some Order skills on your hero that jumps to a whopping 75%, invalidating powerful units entirely! I have had more fun with this games ""swap unit"" spell than I think I've ever had in a Heroes 3 games, being able to invalidate an enemy players strategies by swapping their frontline of foot soldiers with their backline of archers, then walking up and instantly deleting that stack is something I'll never get tired of.

Adding to that power spike is how you build your armies. Each stack of a unit generates spell orbs, meaning that if you build your armies in a way that they are all producing orbs of a single school of magic, you'll quickly find yourself with more magic than you know what to do with. This is especially fun in Songs of Conquest, as unlike Heroes of Might and Magic you can cast multiple spells on the same turn! Some units act as magic 'batteries' specifically for this purpose, the Baryan's Piper unit is pathetic in combat, but generates two Order orbs and has an ability that gives every ally extra turn priority if it hangs back from battle and plays its music. Split that stack in two, and that immediately gives 4 Order orbs and ensures every other unit in the army is going to move before your enemy gets a chance too. Which, if you followed up on that with more Order producing troops, means that you can pacify any ranged units the enemy might have while charging forward with an insanely buffed front line! It's an extremely addictive system that marries the 'might' and 'magic' systems of its predecessors in a way that compliments them both!

This game builds on its predecessor in other ways. Between adding unit stack caps and allowing no sort of 'Town Portal' map traversal ability for your wielders, the game encourages players to have multiple powerful heroes at once to attack or defend on multiple fronts. The unit stacks make spells more effective, as those armies can no longer grow to a size that debuffs become invalidated. And the elevation differences in battle, while being such a simple idea on paper, completely changes up how encounters function as both sides try to compete for the high ground. Again, the swap spell, it's hilarious to walk up to a powerful unit on the high-ground, trade places with it, and use that advantage against them.

There's so much more I could take about. Bases allowing you to build multiple of the same production structure allows hilarious strategies like building ONLY plague rats and drowning opponents in a sea of rodents. Or how being able to delete and refund structures allows you to rapidly shift from a thriving economy to all-out troop production. But I think I've made my point with this review. Yes, this is a spiritual successor to Heroes of Might and Magic, and yes it is enjoyable in many of the same ways that those older games are. But it is also an evolution of that formula, and trying to play it in exactly the same way is a disservice to the mechanics the game possesses. Just try to keep that in mind while playing, because once pushed to their limits these tools are an absolute delight to play with!

(Just one last thing. Campaign missions (While disappointingly short, I do hope they get expanded in length) end with a tavern minstrel singing a literal Song of Conquest about your exploits in the mission you just played. That's awesome. More of that in every video game please)";16.4;1.0;3.0;115.0;Posted: May 18

The game is pretty good.
After playing a lot of HOMM 3 and 5, I just discovered Songs of Conquest. There's a lot of new mechanics, the pixel art is absolutely gorgeous, musics are also neat.

For the gameplay I'd like to say there's some issues about the AI and combat balancing : Melee units kinda feel off, like you just run under the fire of ranged units who can kite you pretty easily and there's no real advantage to backstab units (iirc).

I think the system of essence is cool, but in my opinion it kinda forces you to play to defensive to keep your units and wait the ennemy to collide against a wall of units you did (protecting your ranged units), and after that use all the spells you get.
It should be reworked, I don't really like the idea of having a great map and only play in corner to take the advantage in all fights.";11.6;1.0;0.0;105.0;Posted: May 16

Really neat. Brings out the nostalgia of playing HoM&M. Would recommend, even in the current state. Presumably more cool stuff to come to keep players interested long-term.

Edit: Have played for about 40 hours during the release week. Looking forward to future updates. It seems that the multiplayer scene is slowly growing as it is quite easy to find online games even without prior arrangements with other players. There are bugs and other kinks, but that is to be expected in early access (nothing game-breaking, just some tweaking needed). Also, the learning curve is not that high, so even newer players may enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed. The game is deffinetely a buy.

Simply put. I LOVE IT! Just one more turn...

There are a few hiccups here and there. Some minor performance issues on larger maps, and I found the 4th mission in the Arleon/Human campaign to be a tad bit unbalanced or OP in the AI's favour. It's not impossible to beat but unless you know exactly how to beat the chapter in advance or have been lucky from the start and done the right approach it gets bogged down and you have to reload a lot or even restart.
The devs have announced that they will nerf the campaign AI however so it will probably be fixed in an upcoming update.

Apart from those minor issues I haven't really found anything to complain about.
- The AI in Skirmish play seems balanced and fair. It pose a challange but seems to play by the same rules as the player and doesen't cheat.

- The game ooze of amazing atmoshphere with its beautifull and sometimes very calm sountrack, and stunning artsyle and visuals.

- The factions feel very reminiscent of something you would find in the older heroes of Might & Magic games, especially HOM 2. But manage to distinguish themselves with their own original feel and look.

From what I have played of the story/campaign its quite good and I got invested in the universe and lore.
Some will miss the traditional town screens from other titles in the genre but I found it refreshing, and once you get used to how towns work its great fun and not overwhelming to manage your towns.

Remember, this is not Heroes of Might & Magic. It's a love letter to the genre and a revivial of the old school feel. Which is something the game achieves excellently!
But this is for all intents and purpose Songs of Conquest, a new and original title. Not Heroes of Might & Magic 2,5 or 3,5.

There is so much detail and passion put into this gem. The gameplay is fun and addictive. The atmosphere is spot on.

This game feels like coming home or seeing an old friend. But at the same time its something new you havent quite seen before. And I think this is the closest we will ever come to relive that feeling of discovering Heroes of Might & Magic for the very first time again.

This is also an excellent entry for new players interested in the genre who can't come to terms with how dated a lot of other games in the genre has become over time, or find them hard to run on modern hardware.

The game is in early access so its missing two of its campaigns and there aren't too many skirmish maps to choose from. But the game comes with a map editor so the community can make their own maps and even campaigns.

This game rules, its a game made with love and aimed at getting the feeling playing old Turn Based Strategy Games.

It does this and more, its graphics are utterly stunning, the game play is beautiful and above all else clear. Game Play is challenging but at the same time doable, you just need to challenge yourself, the campaigns are not served on a silver platter but you have to work for it and I love that.

Highly recommended";30.6;1.0;0.0;200.0;Posted: May 21

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
My first impression of this game was bad, however, after more consideration, I decided to change my review to recommended. Most negatives still stand, the game doesn't feel like a new game to me, it's an imitaion of HoMM3 with inferior graphics and much less content.

I don't like the pixelated graphics. It looks much worse then HoMM3 and no, it's not artsy or ""beautiful"" like some have suggested. The buildings are so similar in design, it's hard to tell one from the other.

In spite of the game looking old, the system requirements are to be taken seriously. I played a medium-sized map and it was pretty sluggish going. AI turns took long with the screen greyed-out so you couldn't really see what was going on. It felt like it was lagging. I have an okay PC capable of running most AAA games, but it's not high-end so maybe this is just me.

Now for the positives. I'm gonna try to explain the concept using the example of Arleon, which is an alliance between humans and faey (elves or fairies?). You have 5 human unit types and 3 faey unit types in your town.

The game promotes replayability by encouraging you to only use one or the other in your playthrough. How? Through wielders, which are your standard heroes. Wielders are very specialized and they buff or benefit from certain unit types. Fortunately, you can pick any wielder in the beginning based on what playstyle you want to pursue.

Your towns have building slots. You shouldn't build a barracks for every type of unit. Instead, you should pick 3-4 unit types and build multiple barracks of the same kind. For instance, if you picked a wielder that buffs ranged, you should build 2-3 archery barracks to greatly increase archer generation. Obviously, this means you sacrifice some other buildings as there are only so many slots.

Units come in limited stack sizes and wielders can carry only a certain number of stacks. So in the case of Arleon, you can go with minstrels, footmen, archers and peasants, if your wielder prefers humans, and not recruit any faey. If you have 8 slots in your army, you can decide to carry 3 archers, 2 footmen, 2 minstrels, and 1 peasant and your playstyle will be about protecting your archers, while they defeat the enemy.

Furthermore, even the magic system is tied to your units, so it's another reason/way to handpick an assortment of units. Different units generate different mana types so you want to carefully consider which ""schools"" of magic you want to prioritize and pick your units accordingly.

The number of wielders you can have is tied to the munber of towns you have, so you should capture every settlement you can. Playing 4 wielders affords you a lot of benefits over playing just 1 or 2.

Overall, there is lots to discover and lots to experiment with. I'm currently concerned about the lack of sufficient maps, but hopefully the community gets busy.";17.5;1.0;0.0;109.0;Posted: May 16

A Nostalgic Experience .

Let me start of by praising the developers for the all the hard work they've put into the game. Understanding that this ( while I write this ) is still in EA, it a simply beautifully made. The artwork, graphics, audio and story really gives you the same satisfaction from games of days gone. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience since I've been following the development since its announcement. I am looking forward to the expansions LavaPotion has in store for SoC!

KEEP IN MIND : To anyone who has little to no experience with this genre of games; this is a wonderful place to start as it combines the 8bit 2.5D style of the 90's with a modern graphics feel. However, this game also encapsulates the 90's style of games that gave ZERO floofs and will punish players for tactical blunders. If you want a straightforward game that will give you true satisfaction from defeating the enemy after 74612681 attempts, THIS. IS. FOR. YOU!!";2.3;1.0;0.0;35.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is an fantastic example of early access - there's already plenty of meat on the sturdy bones of this excellent game. The graphics are the beautiful pinnacle of homage-pixel art, and the animations are far smoother than genuine pixel art could ever be. Good blend of modern and retro graphical design.

The gameplay is a great homage to my memories of the Heroes of Might and Magic series, but also modern in its design.
It seems deceptively simple to begin with, but the longer you play, the more depth you discover to the mechanics, unit interactions and character levelling choices. Several times, I was taught a lesson by the AI player, often a very painful lesson, but on learning it I understood the game better. To think, during my first few hours, I thought the magic system was under-powered. Ha!

Sometimes the campaign feels a little unfair and relentless - but persevering and eventually tipping the balance and ending the AI onslaught is very satisfying indeed. The 'just...one more... turn' vibes are strong, and a bit dangerous.

I am really looking forward to seeing where the developers are taking this game in the future. It's already worth the price in its current state, so the idea that more content and polish of existing content is on its way is very exciting.";34.1;1.0;0.0;237.0;Posted: May 19

A really fresh take on HOMM-like tbs genre. The huge one is combat mana system that adds another layer of consideration to composing your armies. First campaign introduces you to all basic mechanics. I especially liked how the last Arleon mission highlights power of magic and initiative.

The game is EA at the moment so there're some bugs, quirks and missing/desired features which will (hopefully) be fixed/ironed out/introduced. There's also a powerful map editor for those who like to explore their creative side so content potential of the game is low-key unlimited.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I was added to the Alpha test for Songs of Conquest extremely late, but was instantly impressed by this game. As many reviews have noted, it is heavily inspired by the Heroes of Might and Magic series, but Songs of Conquest really helped me see how much of my love for HoMM games is based on nostalgia.

First, the combat system is brilliant. The increased complexity of terrain height, troop movement, attacks of opportunity, and stack size limits, for example, really make each movement in battle a careful tactical decision. No longer can I just zip around with fast moving doom stacks! If HoMM was great when I was a kid, SoC is great for me as an adult.

Second, the magic system generates spell points in various schools based on the types of troops in your army and the time elapsed in combat. So rather than devastating spells being the beginning (and thus end) of combat, thy're something you work up to. Magic also informs your troop selection, and makes the development of your army composition a tricky - and interesting - series of decisions. Instead of might vs. magic, the two work together synergistically to deliver a single, unified strategic experience. The downside is that there is a bit of a learning curve for magic in the game. Good tool tips help a lot with that.

Once I understood the above points, I also came to appreciate the wisdom of the developers' decision to simplify the strategic map compared to the old HoMM games and eliminate the town screens entirely. This is meant to be a tighter and faster-paced game than HoMM, and it succeeds in that. The downside is that for the same reason, it may ultimately lack the longevity of those classic games. But it is well worth the asking price already, and I know that the developers have a lot more content planned for this fabulous game!";3.6;1.0;0.0;46.0;Posted: May 23

I would like to recommend this game for everyone, who likes turn based strategy games and pixel art. Personally I like the graphics. For me graphics is not the main thing in a game. I've encountered some minor issue, but the game is in early access so I don't really care. I think this game is fun to play and I wouldn't call this a Heroes of Might and Magic.

Negatives: I think the story is a little bit simple, the fights are a little bit fast (I can't follow the situation on the battlefield sometimes), when I interact with a building on the map I don't have information about the purpose of the building, some spells have not precise description, I think that the spells can be too powerful etc.. These were some negatives.

There is a lot to do still, but I think this game is going to be a worthy successor of the HOMM series. I 100% recommend this game. Thanks for the developers for the work they put in...";33.5;1.0;7.0;35.0;Posted: 16 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pretty fantastic game. Only one big complaint. Tons of depth in places that the retro games this pays homage to don't have, such as in town building, mob fights, etc. This feels like playing one of the good HoMM games (which for me means 2 & 3) but made in the modern era with modern game design principles. Really excellent. Systems in game are more closely linked to each other in a lot of ways than in those older games, so everything is more meaningfully connected between town-building, army-building, the adventure map, and combat. For example, I particularly like how spells and troops are tied together in combat and effected by army layout, it makes for a really nice flow where you pick troops based not exclusively on their direct combat performance, but also their ability to let you cast the right spells for the job, split stacks with that information in mind, and then use the troop moves to improve your spellcasting and use the spellcasting, in turn, to improve and assist your troops' performance. In fact, the feedback loop design in the whole game is impressive.

Buildings can be demolished, which is great. You'd think it would make the game too forgiving, but what it really does is open up a lot of possibilities for dynamic strategy decisions. Forgiving, yes, but at a cost. For example, I demolished a fully upgraded creature dwelling, medium size, because I needed a smaller structure in the short-term that would let me move troops from the rest of my kingdom to my front line, as I was losing a war of attrition with an AI which had a short supply line and was able to replenish troops quickly. After I got the boost, I was able to demolish that structure and rebuild a new creature dwelling. It's really nice to feel like every part of your kingdom can dynamically adapt to changing circumstances (if you're willing to wait for new construction, as construction takes multiple turns) instead of being stuck in whatever configuration you started in.

Unfortunately, I do have that one major complaint, and that's that - for now, anyway - the AI is much too easy on ""normal"" difficulty to be satisfying. ""Normal"" is currently the highest difficulty. There are negative reviews that mention that the AI is too difficult, or cheating. In my experience, that's totally incorrect, at least in any meaningful way. I don't know if the AI *technically* cheats on the back-end or not - I'm not sitting there doing the math for what they must have at their castle or anything - but if it is cheating, it isn't cheating enough. Based on what it was throwing at me I can't imagine it's cheating, because I can't imagine any developer would program an AI to cheat that badly. I assume that people with that impression are either inexperienced at turn-based strategy, or aren't reading descriptions and tooltips. I found my own power level to escalate far faster than the AI even when I made somewhat obvious mistakes, like wasting movement on backtracking, unknowingly wearing artifacts that slowed my adventure speed, forgetting to use secondary wielders, making mistakes that led to needless building demolition, and so on. The AI makes poor tactical and economic decisions, especially in regard to building and to the adventure map. The battle AI is more competent, but it's still too easy to go without losses and snowball. Limited stack size helps a lot with keeping you from snowballing too hard, but the tools are still all there to overwhelm the AI, and the AI doesn't seem to be able to use those tools to fight back well enough. Hopefully a top priority is harder difficulty settings, because I think the core designs of the adventure and combat systems are bordering on genius, especially with how well-thought-out the interactions between systems are.";15.3;1.0;0.0;91.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have been having the honor to stream through the first main campaign with my community and have lots of thoughts! There won't be any spoilers since I really want people to try it themselves. As an older kid who enjoyed watching my parents play HOMM from their deskside, Songs of Conquest feels like an amazing foray into the genre and an absolutely wonderful spiritual successor. The units are all beautifully designed and animated, the campaign itself that I've been through so far has been very fun and full of interesting lore, and I've really enjoyed all the characters and scenery the game presents.
There are, in the later levels, a large difficulty spike that forces you to really be as efficient as possible; mission 3 our of 4 made me restart it entirely due to not really knowing where my town goals were, and while it was a little frustrating, I really enjoyed it actually. Going through the mission entirely blind and then using what I've learned to be more efficient and go through the level more effectively adds a lot of repeatability and really helped me appreciate my own ability to adapt and overcome challenges that I felt were previously insurmountable.

As for skirmishes, I don't have anyone in particular to play multiplayer with currently, haha, so I suppose I won't focus on that as much as I haven't gotten to play it. Game mechanics wise everything feels very sound, although I do find that some of the units being incomplete for some factions and other factions being able to have a stack of 100 vs a max stack of 50 for a base unit is a little... not great? I believe some balancing could be put into place, but it's generally pretty fair. Along with that, this IS a week one review, and I'm sure we'll get additions and stuff later on!

Lastly, while it does not effect my opinions on the gameplay itself, the dev team have been extremely kind and friendly with not only me, an extremely small content creator, but with their entire community and love to get feedback. I just wanted to note that Lavapotion have been absolutely stellar and I'm excited to see the support they give to the game in the future; we just don't have enough developers that are this devoted and lovely nowadays and wanted to give them a shoutout.

Ahh, also, the music in this game? Absolutely stellar. The sound effects all help to feel like you're playing in a fantastic ballad of an epic tale. Along with that, you get little songs for every chapter you complete in the main story, and they are all fantastic!!

TLDR: If you enjoyed HOMM or just like turn-based strategy, I think SoC could be a really fun game for you and highly recommend it!!";17.8;1.0;1.0;111.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Songs of Conquest is a game that you'll probably buy because you are a massive fan of Heroes of Might & Magic. If you are one of those, I can tell you that you can buy it and be satisfied, it is quite faithful while introducing many new things that don't ruin anything. Trust my word as someone who has played all Heroes media over the course of 20 years.

If you aren't a fan of Heroes, then this review is for you.

Playing through Songs of Conquest is a great experience, something you'd curl up to during a fresh may day and immerse yourself in while hearing the birds chirping outside. It is quite relaxing and stimulating. I'll try to explain the pros and cons of the game as best as I can during the course of this review.

The game is divided into three parts. The management, the adventuring, and the combat.

The management and adventuring are neatly combined together so I'll talk about them first. There is no one singular map in the game, rather many different maps with different goals and playstyles. On each map, your goal is to go around the map collecting resources and treasure to amass power for yourself, whether it is empowering your wielder with artifacts or getting access to stronger armies by buying them with the resources you have gathered. This part of the game is very good, with a nice ambient soundtrack, and some amazing visuals. (Which we will get into later) It has a nice sense of progression, as better loot is typically guarded by harder enemies, which you have to face in combat.

When in combat, you are put into an entirely different game, seemingly, as you then have to use the troops you have to fight enemy creatures in a chess-like environment, with a field that has a hexagonal field. There are many different aspects to combat, such as elevation giving bonuses to your units in combat, terrain you cannot move your units to and through, as well as magic that your wielder can cast to turn the tides of battle. It is always quite tense and exciting as you would optimally not want to lose any units, and in late-game battles, it can become insane.

Your wielder is the person which will be leading your armies and moving around the adventure map. It gives a very nice RPG element as you can give them new skills, and upgrade existing ones, of which there are many - all the while giving them differing equipment and artifacts. There are also trade-offs when leveling up with your hero in the skills that you choose, so it is always going to feel more personalized the more you play and the hero you have sees so much progress.

On a technical side however, the game suffers. There are currently a substantial amount of bugs, thankfully none of which seem to be too gamebreaking. This is fine in my eyes however as the game is still in early access. The graphics are great, however, giving a sort of Stardew Valley kind of vibe.

There are also some balancing issues where there are some blatantly overpowered and underpowered things in the game. In the campaign, there is also one very insane difficulty spike which struck me as odd.

Overall, though, the game is great, and I'd easily recommend it, especially as the devs are relatively nice to the community and transparent, with many updates being churned through. I'd give it a higher rating maybe in the future, but for now, until the bugs and balancing issues are fixed, as well as the relative lack of content, I am giving it a";37.0;1.0;0.0;185.0;Posted: May 19

I played only some single player maps and campaigns, and I enjoyed the game mechanics very much.
I.e. the casting system feels very fresh, the building system is very nice, hero levelling is very enjoyable etc. There are also few things that could be a bit better: i.e. the campaign difficulty could be more balanced, the wait/defend commands in combat could be more classic, and unit recruitment system could get some love too.

Music: (8/10)
The music in the game is truly immersive, I love it.
I lowered the grade because of two reasons:
1) songs between scenario missions felt a bit cringe to me, mostly because of lyrics which were like... I dunno man, I just didn't like it very much
2) this game is a gem, and the music is nice, but I cannot say it couldn't be a bit better. When I remember i.e. HoMM3 fortress theme, it's more accomplished, recognisable and rememberable orchestral score. It's dumb to compare, I know, but I can't help myself, sorry guys, love the game anyway!


Maybe this is too harsh, but I find the story somewhat average. I don't know what's there to be invented in this genre, and I enjoy references to other classic games, but simply put, I don't think the story is as brilliant as the other parts of the game. Still very good job tho.

All considered, this game is a heartwarming suprise, and I would love to see more campaigns, more factions and I am anxious to try the multiplayer soon with my friends :-)

I would encourage everyone to go and buy it, so the devs can continue the amazing work. Well done!";11.9;1.0;1.0;96.0;Posted: May 19

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I am going to give a thumbs up and call it a day for the good stuff this game has to offer right at the moment.
The game is pretty awesome! It's like a reinterpretation of HoMM3 with it's own quirk and balancing.



The list below is for the design choice I disagree with and like to ask for some changing in the future.
- The artifacts are quite bland. Mostly just numeric buff. More broken stuff would be appreciated. The fun of HoMM is to exploit the game, the more broken, the better it feels. Please let players fly across the map, immune to Armagedon, and walk over water.
- Faction locked units are boring, while better balanced, it's boring. It makes playing bigger maps become a drag more than enjoyable because players are getting stuck with 6 same cities with the same unit roster late game.
- Market is too generous, I see a little penalty to trade resource (especially for rare ones) to just bypass the need to gather the resource.
- I can see why capping the unit count is a thing (more balance better chance of comeback.) However, it makes every game feel a bit too similar with too conventional plan. As I have mentioned, crazy sandbox thing makes HoMM so good.
- Please limit the amount of spell you can use each turn, seriously.

Still, there are something a bit here and there like option to fasten the animation (it's not a particular slow game but I just want to rush it through sometime.)";11.3;1.0;0.0;631.0;Posted: May 20

This is a really nice turn based strategy game. May need some balance but its some good ol' fashioned graphics with hex plotted movement board and a beautiful map .


Pros:
very tightly created to fit the genre
beautiful graphics
pleasant game play with offensive and defensive bonuses or weaknesses
gear for your hero such as armors, weapons, and jewelry .
Quality of loot drops not just one standard but ranging from common to legendary
Good variety of enemies
various resources to maintain your camp


Cons:
I would say only one, balance of NPC

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Nostalgia for HoMM 3 led me to this tile, and while I was following the game with much interest, I did not know what to expect from its early access stage. Now I do, and I felt the urge to write down my thoughts to process the substantial impact this experience left on me. It is a personal piece, and a praise, but a candid and reflected one, from which I hope that you, dear reader, can take away some conclusions, if you are in the mood for a lengthy critique. Feel free to skip to the last paragraph to find my summary.

The certainty of experiencing something special trickled in immediately upon launching the game. It required a bit of time to set up a quick skirmish game, to choose a small map, and to decide on the faction I would take, as well as that of my opponent. While my brain went to operate in strategy game learning mode, focusing on concepts and preferences and numbers, a feeling emerged, faintly at first, but soon overwhelming. At a certain threshold, I realized it was caused by the mesmerizing music, whose melancholy, pathos, subtlety, and sincerity deeply sucked me into the world of Songs of Conquest. What a fitting title for a game carried by its strong music, and with a musician in each faction! Before even starting my first play session, my analytical stance was gone, and replaced with intense immersion, joy, and anticipation. After transitioning to the actual game, my initial feelings were substantiated and further intensified by the gorgeous pixel art, the vivid animations, the rich and busy world, the vibrant and spot-on sound design, and the lore. So, if my comments appear overly enthusiastic from time to time, please bear in mind that I fell in love quickly and heavily with this one.

After being blown away and naively wandering through the exciting world for a while, my strategic thinking, while still taking a back seat, slowly returned - after all, losing is not fun, even if it is presented gorgeously. At this time, it became clear that the game did not rely on smoke and mirrors to fascinate for a brief while, but that underneath all the splendor, there exists a rock-solid foundation built from tight design, a clear vision, and great overall balance, allowing the streamlined interlocking systems to become larger than the sum of their parts. Let me explain. Many reviews complain about altered or missing features from the HoMM series, like the unit cap on stacks, the seemingly weak magic, or the difficulty to achieve lossless fights. While these design decisions certainly shift the game feel away from HoMM 3, which surely can curtail your enjoyment with the title, I see the in them thoughtful modernizations countering (in a certain way extremely satisfying) tactics such as concentrating units to render single heroes close to invincible, or winning not by units, but with vastly overpowered spells.

Songs of Conquest embraces the tension of close decisions, bloody battles and risk-reward thinking that is core to the early game feeling of the HoMM franchise, and strives to maintain it longer through the game session than its predecessors, which more often than not spiral out of control, abruptly ending runaway winning and expansion streaks through singular (albeit epic) fights between superheroes, won by the bigger doomstack (adjusted for overpowered relics, skills, and spells). Songs' experience is different, but I appreciate it highly: Lossless fights are still a thing, but they do not come granted with a large army or spellbook. The limited unit and army size encourages experimentation with different compositions, and the novel magic system further augments the relevance of unit choice, as spells are fueled by acting units, not by mana reserves. There also is a common complaint that the units do not possess enough special abilities. While the game could benefit from increased asymmetry (there is room for more abilities, faction-specific spells or building effects), the units are far from being interchangeable. Even just with basic stats, they adopt distinct combat roles. Clearly the game benefited from extensive balancing before being released into early access. Not the cookie-cutter balance evening everything interesting out of your game, but the feeling that each designed item, spell, unit and system has a purpose, even if it might be only niche. Some areas still need polish (I always wanted research in my HoMM, but the present implementation is rather formulaic), but I am impressed by what already is here.

Clarity is a big strength of Songs, and I am quite certain that the developers were extremely conscious in their decisions and executed their vision stringently. The result is a great game flow which does not overwhelm you with intricate decisions, does not waste your time with busy work (we could talk about picking up all the glitter here, though), and from time to time poses a good challenge to mix things up (enemy hero approaching capital, main hero bound with converting an enemy city, secondary and tertiary heroes exploring). Like in many good board games, simple subsystems interact to regularly create challenging decisions while keeping the outcomes and reasons for failure and success clear. This is a foundational but especially hard aspect of design: Cut what is distracting, cut what is not working properly, cut what is undermining other systems, avoid feature and scope creep, to arrive at a faceted jewel.

In the same accord, the UI is slick and presents all relevant information in a well-arranged fashion (OK, let us not talk about the town defence organization screens, these really feel clunky, but particularly so because of the ease you navigate through the rest of the game). The factions feel familiar and far from standard fantasy tropes at the same time, making them both immediately relatable and unique. While I very much appreciated HoMM's high fantasy setting (which wonderfully supports the powerful magic and the colorful and expressive range of characters), the great heaviness and sincerity of Songs' lore serves its own atmosphere excellently, which is further supported by clever presentation (I love the level up zoom and bang, the visual and sound effects when the souls of a defeated army are released (which can be heard globally, even in absence of vision, during turn calculation), and the battle victory screen highlighting the final action). These loads of immersion really got me into roleplaying feels, fighting epic battles for the good of my faction.

Nostalgia that can never be truly relived, and will always be remembered through bittersweet, rose-tinted glass. Nothing is ever perfect, and it is impossible to fulfill all expectations when trying the daring task to live up to a decade old legend. Songs of Conquest has the courage to recreate the strengths of such a legend. For this courage, it is rewarded, ending up both as a beautiful piece of art and an emerging masterpiece in its own right. It proves again that a small but capable, passionate and considerate team is able to achieve what all the disconnected executives and Ubisofts in their industrialized, greed-driven corporate mindset failed to accomplish with far more material resources and numbing crunch. But without fostering inspiration, the genuine joy of creation, and the human desire for expression, such an endeavor can never reach its true potential.

In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend Songs of Conquest to anyone looking for a crisp, holistic, nuanced, and well-flowing turn-based strategy experience, for people wanting to scratch their HoMM 3 itch in a carefully yet distinctly modernized way, and for fans of deeply atmospheric, artistic games, especially in the dark fantasy and retro settings. It is a rare example of a love letter which manages to avoid old pitfalls, knows well what to preserve, what to overhaul, what to remove and what to add, and executes on these difficult decisions with great confidence in its own qualities.";16.4;1.0;2.0;296.0;Posted: May 21

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's familiar for Heroes of Might and Magic players, but better and and with more depth, if you can believe it. It is amazing.

Because map creation is easy, there is already a healthy amount of maps being made. This is the key ingredient that could help Songs of Conquest become as timeless as HeroesIII.

There is a limit to the number of units for each troop stack, so you (and your opponent) are forced to spread your army. So now you can't just assign your whole military on one hero, which makes for many more strategic decisions to make.

Songs of conquest, gives freedom to customize the buildings in your city. So now, you get to decide what units your city will generate. But it also means that you now need to be conscious about your economy. Unlike HoMM and its straightforward economy, it's up to you to get the right ressource/unit balance. Also, there is a tech tree! The tech tree is very important, and the ressources required to gain upgrades will have to be considered when building armies. The tech tree is a huge hole that needs to be filled with ressources, you'll probably never feel like gathering ressources stops being useful at any point in a normal game.

A thing that veterans might not like: the magic. The spell system takes time to get used to, but I like it. There are only a handful of damage-dealing spells, and they're pretty weak. This makes combat much more interesting. a fireball might change nothing to the combat's outcome, but summoning a bush to block the path to your ranged units could pull the odds in your favor.

As of writing, It is Early access, so there are little unpolished things here and there: Some spells can level-up, but you are just never told how. some units can have a speed of 3, which are so slow that they become unusable because the fight will end before they reach any target. Also, It's a chore to manage troops in cities.";40.2;1.0;0.0;660.0;Posted: May 18

GET THIS GAME GET IT WHILE ITS HOT!!

This game plays a lot like Heroes of might and Magic 3 Another great great game! In fact its a lot better than HOMM3! The battles are also a lot more better. Unfortunately they're not as great as Fort Triumph's battles. Its almost similar I think to Eador.

It comes with a map editor and has workshop access.

Get this game, Get HOMM3 HD also on steam and another game like them I can't think of right now off the bat!

The graphics are pixelated like SNES games and RPGS and they have great campaigns available too! Like the HD version of HOMM3 there is no random map generator but never mind. They never could get it right with it. It also has a tutorial that is easy to understand. The first campaign is awaesome and a good way to learn the ropes.

You can play it as a 4 X fantasy or as a stand alone RPG with characters and stories.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is very like a poor graphics version (we're talking 1990s/ early 2000s pixelated graphics) of Heroes of Might and Magic II, except that there are stack size limits (an improvement) and you can research various things (including small increases in stack size, increased stats for units etc).

Current big downsides - no strategic map music until you complete campaigns unless you pay half again as much money for a supporter pack, which seems very mean.

No settings for Animation speed so far in the Supporter version of the game I bought (which is £37, half again as much as cheaper version). People in discussions tell me they exist - yet i've been through every settings screen, both from the main menu and in battles, and they don't exist.

You can't turn off the often dozen or more page conversations with encounters, allies and enemies which come up frequently in the missions either. Which you have to spend time clicking through a dozen times after reloading a game or replaying a mission.

There are (low) limits on how many new buildings you can build in towns/cities, which give so many build slots (e.g 2 medium and 3 small in a medium settlement). Each type of building requires a particular slot size. Since there are only 3 missions worth playing just now and this limits you to no barracks in 1 of 3 settlements you can viably take in the 3rd mission (has 4 towns, most of any mission), this is quite a limitation on recruiting units. As is there being two research buildings which each require a large building slot, and the highest tier units you can get also requiring a building that needs a large building slot. So you can only really have one army strong enough to do much until the mission is almost over (taking he 4th city triggers the arrival of last enemy hero army, beating it ends the mission).

Magic is interesting, but in the first campaign getting any options to take magic skills when levelling seems to be a rare thing. While one of the AI heros in the third mission can kill 3 human units with a single spell (they can be beaten, by taking a town that lets you recruit non-human troops).

And only two playable campaigns at the start - one frogmen (no interest in them for me), the other humans who are fine, but unfortunately the fourth mission of the human campaign is currently virtually impossible. There is a video made by the devs of how it can be done - but only by taking 4 specific skills which may or may not even come up as options when you play through the first three missions, and which aren't necessarily ones you'd want to pick or which would be best for other missions.

And you can only complete that mission by playing the first four battles exactly the way the devs show in the video, with exactly those skills, and all four will by pyrrhic victories in which you lose most of your troops. This makes it currently not worth playing any further for me.

They do say in the discussion forums that they'll be fixing that mission by ""slightly"" nerfing AI neutral stack sizes (which seems like far less change than would be necessary), but not when they'll be doing it. If they added more and better troops to your starting army and nerfed the AI armies blocking the *only* route you can take at the start of that mission, then it might be worth playing.

You can play designer made single player maps which work fine, and download dozens of player made ones to play too.

The first 3 campaign missions give you 2 heroes in the 2nd and 3rd missions, but not remotely enough towns and too high a rate of attacks by enemy heroes' armies to allow you to have more than one army strong enough to do anything except for very late in the 3rd mission, when there's no longer time to use the second one.";18.9;1.0;0.0;75.0;Posted: May 20

First of all, I love the potential of this game, I must because I beat my head against a wall for 3 hours to try an learn it.

*Read edit at bottom for change to recommend!*

Why is my review negative? Because, even on easy this game is brutal. My god, I played 6 skirmish games against an easy a.i. and got absolutely brutalized all 6 times. Each time I would get my base to level 2 and the enemy player would already be at level 3 and covering the map with leaders like a swarm of locusts. It was wild, I'd kill one army and 2 more would take it's place. I don't even know how the ai could replace units that fast. Just dial it back down from 11/10 on the crazy scale is all I ask.

I think this game has everything going for it, I'm keeping it and I really hope the devs hear me. I don't mind if there's a bunch of difficulties and hardcore players get normal on up but, at least make easy a.i. manageable enough to be beatable for a lame old fuddy-duddy like me.

*Ok, so I finally won against that a.i. - there is a custom edit for your map and you can limit the number of wielders on a map. By doing this you can effectively chill the locust swarm down a bit to learn the game.

I really liked the drawing, as well as the immense love for the second characters, pushed me to buy this masterpiece
to say that the game is ingenious, no, the meat process does not turn in the mouth, but the fact that the game is made at a very high level, I can say this with confidence, but there are also a couple of black mixture fillers in bochenko with honey
vulture: 9/10, lacks the kind of castles that were in the second and 3 heroes, he was so captivating
music: 6/10, when compared with heroes 2-4, it is definitely much worse
gameplay: 7.5/10 a huge plus is that the developers added their own features and did not completely make a clone, but since the game still does not have a normal balance, it is not obvious which monsters are weak which are strong, this introduces its own confusion and misunderstanding into the game, in this game is similar to the first kingbounty, where you can be knocked out by the most sucker.
I’ll separately take out the balance of campaigns: because of it I couldn’t advance in 4 missions on the first monster, my hero was destroyed over and over again, so my development in 3 missions was too fast and my hero didn’t pump himself enough for 4 to die immediately on the first one, for this a huge minus, this should not be in the game, it is very unprofessional not in game design
I recommend the game, but only if you are ready to face a bad balance, and an unfinished company, and if a lot of changes are made to the game, new factions and a lot of monsters are added, the game will have a lot more fun, I would also like melodies like in 3-4 heroes.";5.5;1.0;0.0;20.0;Posted: May 16

Mild Story Spoilers for the First Campaign Mission Ahead:

I've never played Heroes of Might and Magic, so to me my closest comparison is to Warcraft 3. I prefer games that have a story, that have world building, that find a way to pull you in and tug at your heartstrings a little. I like to be immersed. When I was first introduced to the game watching a YouTuber play it, it struck me as generic. The songs were a neat touch, but hasn't this all been done before? And then I watch as the protagonist mercilessly butchers a bunch of rebel farmers, threatens others for not dying in her name while she was away, and wince as she brutally attacks a party of strange and potentially friendly foreigners.

Oh, they wrote an actual story.

The game is drenched in atmosphere. The music is outstanding, the story is minimal in the style of many old strategy games but full of nuance, scraps of history in the environment, the artifacts, the character interactions, and the army rosters themselves. The world feels deep, lived in, full of stories.

The gameplay itself, while distinct and very different from anything I've played before, is really fun to figure out and play with. It's not especially intuitive, but it's clearly very well designed. I've completed both campaigns now, with a lot of saving and reloading before potentially risky moves, and I can't say I've got a great grasp on how to play optimally in terms of base-building, army composition, etc., but I had an absolute blast. Exploring the world, leveling up heroes/wielders, meeting challenges with the forces you've managed to scrape together, seeing how skills, the wonderfully deep spell system, tech trees, your heroes inventory, world buffs, and units all work together to do awesome things, it's all great fun!

Keep in mind that the game is in early access. There are eight campaign missions at present, each can easily take between 1-4 hours depending on whether you fully explore the map and kit up your characters (which I do recommend) or blitz for the objectives. While I encountered no game-breaking bugs, the enemy AI did seem to break a couple of times, with an enemy wielder who was probably meant to be out seizing resources and making the player's life more difficult was instead just sat in their own base, or trapped behind some resources, staring angrily out at the world. Also, both campaigns are clearly just opening chapters. They set up the conflicts, why the factions have the units they do, and who some of the major lore characters are, and they each resolve an arc of the larger story, but they practically beg to be continued further. I really hope we get to see more of that story because the foundations are fantastic.

Songs of Conquest, in its present state, is a brilliant introduction to a largely forgotten genre of game. It has story, deep and engaging gameplay, and a whole lot of potential. There's at least a minimum of 24 hours of narrative campaign gameplay, and a whole lot more if you get into playing skirmish games or decide to try out the map editor or the community maps. If it got a few bug fixes and were released as is, I would be glad to have purchased the game. I'm eager to see what more is added, to see the fundamentals polished further, and especially to see what more is built upon these excellent foundations.";43.1;1.0;1.0;102.0;Posted: May 19

First impressions after 15 or so hours played, I've only tried the campaigns. This game seems a masterpiece. I'm in awe at how they've managed to reinvent the HoMM formula, adding so much more complexity to battles without losing any of the charm. The spell system is ingenious and so much fun. The devs are communicating with the fans here and on Reddit which is important, too. I'm also thankful that it's available on mac.

Lavapotion has done an excellent job with this, and I hope Songs of Conquest takes off for them. My main wish for the full release is just ... more campaign content, I guess? But I understand the community tools are great so this game will never lack stuff to do I think. Looking forward to trying that myself as well as coop multiplayer soon.";19.8;1.0;1.0;48.0;Posted: May 19

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Good, but not great. There are a lot of good mechanics about this game and it is fun to see how the developers have innovated the spellcasting system. They have also done a good job with making the factions interesting with fun heroes and units. However, in its current state there are some problems with the game. If you are familiar with strategy games and the HOMM-series in particular this game is far too easy. As of now in the Early Access there are only two difficulty modes available for the AI: easy and normal.

Let's be fair cheating is a part of the AI in most strategy games, and I do not mind it as much. I would rather have an AI who is cheating a bit than meet underdeveloped heroes with half my army size. This is happening very often right now when I play a skirmish game.

Another problem ties into the difficulty level a little bit, but not necessarily. One of my skirmish games was over in only 15 rounds and there was no apparent reason as to why. It could be that it managed to capture 3 victory points, but it really shouldn't in such a short time. Likewise I was able to win a game in only 30 turns. Both of these games were on a 4 player map.

The game would also benefit from having more factions.

I am looking forward to the continued development of this game and I really think it can turn out great";10.0;1.0;1.0;474.0;Posted: May 19

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Songs of Conquest hearkens back to the style of classic strategy RPGs like Heroes of Might and Magic. Visually the game looks great, the character sprites are detailed and expressive with colorful maps to traverse. However, sometimes wandering around the map to collect resources is a bit tedious when there isn't much else going on around you. Gameplay is easy enough for a beginner, there are helpful tutorials that can be toggled on and off, but it also has enough depth for those seeking to immerse themselves in the more strategic elements such as building up your town's defense and productivity.

The UI is simple enough to navigate and doesn't make you feel bogged down by menus. Building your settlements is fun and watching the buildings evolve as you upgrade them to produce more soldiers and resources is satisfying. The battle system incorporates the usage of terrain and elevations to give advantages or disadvantages depending on your positions. It's simple enough to pick up the battles, but mindlessly attacking won't bring you to victory so it's important to think about how to use your troops to their capacity. Despite being melee troops, the footmen seemed awfully weak and felt like sending paper soldiers off to battle. The Rangers on the other hand, were extremely useful. You can also upgrade the different troop types as you advance your settlement.

The music is...present. It's not bad by any means and sometimes there are cutscenes with bards singing songs but it didn't feel very memorable.

Overall the game seems very well made thus far and is a very enjoyable experience if you like old-school strategy RPGs.";9.0;1.0;0.0;155.0;Posted: May 20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has excellent potential. It very obviously spawned from Heroes of Might and Magic III, but it feels like it improves on all fronts, except for maybe one. Here's a handful of changes I think are good

- Hero chaining isn't really possible anymore because you're limited in how many heroes you can employ. It's also not as necessary because there's a town building you can make to hire units from across all your towns
- Magic is much more balanced IMO and purely combat oriented, although in some ways it feels a little bit less interesting because in this game you know all spells, it's just a matter of generating the spell points needed to cast them. Magic generally feels less powerful overall (no longer tier 3 hasting your entire army to win the game), but its still effective and worth investing in.
- Unit stack sizes are now limited. I think this is a good change. Overall your army strength is heavily determined by your stats instead of amassing 2k skeletons.
- Towns are much more simplified. You can only make so many buildings, and your town can't do everything. However you can sell buildings and buy buildings strategically just to meet some requirements and then sell them later. It makes city building more tactical and generally makes different areas more specialized.

My biggest grip with this game is there is no random map generator which is a MASSIVE problem for this game IMO, but I know the devs are working on it and have plans to get it in EA or 1.0, so I'm not concerned about it. However if this game doesn't release without a random map generator, I might honestly change my review.";15.4;1.0;4.0;204.0;Posted: May 17

I've been following the progress of this game for a while now. It's been fun watching it all slowly come together until now. The game has finally come out into Early Access.
I'll get it out of the way, I'm sure the real reason you're reading this is because you want to know two things and really just two things only.
1: Is this better than HoMM 3? Well that depends. Have you been playing that game since it's release? If ""Yes"" then the answer will most likely be ""No"".
You honestly shouldn't stack it up to HoMM 3, let this (like all games) stand on their own merit.
2: Is it a good game and should I buy it? Yes. The game is fantastic and if you DO enjoy games like HoMM 3 you'll most likely have a good time with it. The gameplay is solid (and will get better as time goes on), the music isn't distracting and peaceful and the sprites and animation is fun and fluid.
I'd personally give this game a 8/10.
Don't be afraid to check it out, give it a chance. You might find you very much have a good time with it. I know I have.";9.2;1.0;1.0;359.0;Posted: May 17

I have only played 3.5 hours up to now but I have loved every minute. I have played homam 2 and 3 throughout my childhood and I go back to the 3 once a year, and I have never found a game that kind of recalled that while giving me something new. Songs of conquest is a really fun evolution.

No gameplay spoilers ahead.

-The graphics are really pretty and everything moves smoothly, animations are fast but not too sped up and all of them can be skipped.
-THERE ARE BARD SONGS AS CUTSCENES. Such a nice touch. Also the music in general is just awesome.
-The battles are structured and work like Heroes but other than being faster and having have great animation they have some new mechanics that are really interesting, such as terrain differences that give this or that advantage/disadvantage to units. The spells are also different, but it's too long to explain, look it up!
-The story imo is quite immersive. You play as this badass woman-knight with badass lines. All playable side characters (the ones that in Heroes would have been, well, your heroes) have unique lines and interact with your main hero through the scenarios.
-It gets appropriately hard appropriately fast. As expected, only the first few scenarios are run-through. The rest punished me hard for wasting time!

I'll update my review with more information including downsides when I finish the game. I hope this was helpful! Ask me anything else about it and I'll do my best to reply asap :)";4.4;1.0;0.0;75.0;Posted: May 18

Really fun game in a sort of modernized Heroes of Might and Magic system. The game is already pretty fleshed out for an early access game with 4 factions and 2 campaigns. It has a lot of strategic depth both within the tactical battle system and the overworld, I really like that the game is challenging which requires you to actually think and make the best use of your moves rather than just steamroll with a deep stack, there is a lot of decision making space. Suprisingly active multiplayer base too! Also the art is gorgeous.

Excellent!
SoC is very close to HOMM (the closest I've found in terms of quality), while also freshly original, many subtle improvements and including smart new concepts.
(i.e. best turn based fantasy strategy, including economics and RPG hero elements)

Well balanced, beautifully polished, good music scores and sound effects.
On of my favourite aspects is 'reactiveness' - I found that so much attention was put into ensuring that the player does not have to wait for trivial actions and animations (the load times after battles can still be improved and there are also some unoptimized visual transitions between turns, but otherwise, wow - almost all actions have been carefully planned to deliver ideal player experience)

This is proof that we (still) don't need Unreal5 visuals to make awesome games - it's the passion and attention to detail that count a LOT.

No bugs for my entire campaign playthrough of an early access release - that is absolutely incredible, and almost unheard of in the 21st century! Well done LavaPotion you deserve some medals for pulling off something like that.

There are still several rough edges, and I would have LOVED a sprawling 10 mission campaign with optional side missions and carry over bonuses (sadly only two 4 mission campaigns for now).
Will be keeping a close eye on this. If LavaPotion (In another few years or so) can expand and improve Soc2 in the same way that HOMM2 did over HOMM1 I will not be able to contain my excitement.";36.4;1.0;2.0;1277.0;Posted: May 18

As a huge fan of Heroes Of Might And Magic, I was excited for Song of Conquest and have been following its development for many months. Although the HoMM inspiration is strong, Song of Conquest is its own game.

Pros:
- beautiful, high-quality pixel art (I'm not even a fan of pixel art tbh)
- good map design (filled with treasure, creatures, and unique items)
- challenging (I'm still in the first campaign, but the difficulty increase between maps is good imo),
- beautiful music
- feels very polished for an early access
- I like the town-building concept, the limited number of building slots forces the player to choose upgrades wisely. I really hope they will continue to develop this feature.

Cons
- Capped unites (you have a maximum number of units from each type. Maybe this is a good feature, since it forces you to distribute your army between heroes, but I prefer stacking THRONGS of troops :P)
- Some QoL / UI issues (moving troops between heroes feels like a chore).

Lots of potential! The basic idea of HOMM3 but with some unique ideas like stack limits, and gradually unlocking additional unit slots as you level. It's still early access and you'll feel that at times when there's a feature you just want so bad, but you know it's going to be a while before they're past the bug fixes and more priority patches.

This is deal breaker for most, at the moment there is no simultaneous turns so you need to take a step back into the 90's and a return to hot seating. My big wish is for at least the ability to review in game stats when it's your turns but at the moment you're basically locked out of everything.

My recommendation if you can't wait for another HOMM fix and need it now is to get yourself some wireless headphones and do other stuff until it's your turn. Not going to lie my house has never been cleaner until starting this one with a buddy.";56.3;1.0;0.0;310.0;Posted: May 16

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A very well-made game. It is heavily inspired by HoMM 3, yet it manages to distinguish itself by introducing a couple of unique mechanics, which drastically change gameplay.

- City building system, coupled with stack limits allows for a lot of build diversity.
- Magic system is unique, interesting and powerful, if used correctly.
- Visual design is of a very high quality.
- Campaigns present the story pretty well - the musical cutscenes are a nice addition.

Still, there are a couple of areas in which the game could use a bit more development.

- Some minor QoL features are missing. Moving troops from the town defenders to your Hero is a bit of a chore, you can't replay auto-resolve, you can't repeatedly shift-cast spells e.t.c.
- The game lacks simultaneous turns. They might get added later, but so far the multiplayer is pretty slow, especially if you are playing something other than a duel.
- Unit abilities and faction mechanics are too similar. The majority of research upgrades are pretty much the same across the factions, units have a lot of same-y abilities. A bit more diversity would be nice.
- While the campaigns are pretty good, they only cover 2 out of 4 playable in-game factions, and are pretty short on missions - each campaign only has 4 of them.

All in all, the game is pretty enjoyable to play right now and has a lot of potential in the future.";109.5;1.0;21.0;213.0;Posted: 16 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I am writing this review after having played 5 hours.

I can't believe it took this long to have a new game in the genre of HoMM3.

Visually speaking, what an update!
The game is visually gorgeous, the pixel look within a 3D space is a great way to give it a fresh modern look while still calling back to its retro origins. Every sprite is carefully crafted and animated and it is so nice to see them move.

The Over-world

The world map movement and interactions feels every bit the same as HoMM3 and I would not want it any other way.

The most notable change is that your town and every building in it is physically present on the map. I think this is a great add-on because because it makes the action of making your town and expanding it much more tangible and satisfying.

Speaking of it,I love how they handled the town building. You are offered with a limited amount of spots for your buildings but you are allowed to decide the locations, types and quantity of buildings you want to have in your town. It is a nice additional strategy layer that lets you specialise your towns for your needs. You could potentially have a town that only produces resources or one that is made to focus on creating as much units as possible. It really does feel like an improvement to HoMM3.



I would say the combat is the part of the game that changed the most.

The tactical aspect stays true to its origins, while adding features that only deepen the experience. (The elevations that gives you defensive or ranged bonuses are a welcomed improvement).
Units have a variety of special abilities that gives them a specific play style. For instance, I am still on my first game with the Barya faction and I love how the spearman has extended reach and can attack through other units. It is something that I don't think was present in HoMM3 and it makes for fun tactics. That said, I really hate that the musketeers need to reload.

The spell slinging is probably one of the more unique aspect from the game. You don't have just one type of mana, you now have 4. From what I have seen, they are mostly affected by the hero you chose and the type of units he carries with it. During combat, you start with no mana and you accumulate it depending of which actions you make with your troops, mixing the different type of mana to cast various spells.
Compared to HoMM3, it changes the relation you have with your mana. Where you once saved it for strategically important fights, you are now encouraged to use it as soon as you have it. It makes casting spells something you do on a much more regular basis, which is nice. But the sad thing is that you lose what was once an important resource to manage, making the choice of using spells a much more trivial one.



Like I said, I have been playing for almost 5 hours and I am having a blast!
There are things I am not 100% on board with, but in this case the good definitely outweighs the bad.
At this time, I already have the feeling that this is a game I will be coming back to on a regular basis.

For an Early Access, this is extremely solid. There are tweaks and balancing to be made but I am confident the devs will be responsive to the community and tackle these issues as they come up.

With the success it already has, I can only hope there will be new factions, maps and scenarios overtime because this game surely deserves it.

For any HoMM enjoyer, this game is a must buy.";4.3;1.0;0.0;146.0;Posted: May 20

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Reading the reviews, it sucks hearing that people think this is a cash grab. The initial campaign shows that they've dedicated a good handful of time towards creating a strong, respectful future for the HoMM genre. The game has small quirks that need to be worked out but, overall, the game is fantastic.

Combat has an interesting flair with the starting locations. I wish I could place units where I wanted to or in more varied spaces. The enemy started at an advantage but I'm also APPROACHING the enemy so I should expect that. Overall I didn't lose too much during combat and it forced me to go against my ""CHARGE WITH MY FACE"" mentality.

If you're a fan of this genre, the tactical genre, or anything strategic, you'll find love in Songs Of Conquest.

Thanx to the developers for this game.

Songs of Conquest is positioned as a spiritual successor of the Heroes series, but it delivers a quite unique experience, and in some ways is more complex than Heroes. I see SoC as a well-crafted mix of Heroes 3, Age of Wonders, King's Bounty from Katauri and a generous seasoning of original ideas.

This game was just released into the early access, but it's already stuffed with content and replayability. Songs of Conquest has a great potential, and I trully believe that it will be a big success it deserves to be. Ofcourse, there are some bugs and glitches, some not-so-well thought out game solutions, but I 146% sure, that the vast majority of issues and inconviniences will be fixed by the full release.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First time I've played a turn-based strategy game like this since the battle for wesnoth in the 2000s (just found out they're still updating it, wow). Really captivating artwork, animation, and music. Combat is mostly intuitive with a relatively simple to understand unit/base progression system. Resource management is also pretty straight-forward, and the marketplace building makes getting whatever you need for upgrades really easy... maybe too easy hah!

Just finished the first campaign after many failed attempts, and the most glaring issue is probably the snowball effect of the AI. If you're not constantly attacking and whittling down the enemy troops, you'll simply fall too far behind and get wiped eventually. This was frustrating for someone like me who likes to slowly capture/explore every part of the map as I play. On the fourth stage of the first campaign, the only way I could win was to rush the objective before the enemy units could stack too high. Playing this way left about 30% of the map unexplored for me. Possible solution for the devs might be to increase the time before a wielder can respawn making your victories more rewarding by giving you time to rebuild and explore.

Apart from the AI snowballing, this game is still super fun. Excited to see what sort of additional units/buildings they put in the game as well as more campaigns. Also a co-op campaign would be pretty neat.";30.8;1.0;0.0;71.0;Posted: May 23

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If Heroes of Might and Magic, King's Bounty and Disciples were to have a child, this would be exactly what it feels like.
I didn't expect the game to be so enjoyable, this is the most fun I'm having in turn-based strategy games of this specific subgenre since Heroes V, and it manages to deliver this specific type of chill and tactical gameplay perfectly.

The strongest aspect of the game would definitely be its magic system, it's quite original and fun to tinker with! Your units basically double as mana batteries, each having its own ""essences"" they add to your essence pool every time the unit is to make a turn. You then proceed to cast whatever you want provided you can cover its essence cost, no need to learn spells and add them to your spellbook besides most powerful ones that require a hero skill, it's that simple!

Building system is also pretty good! You quite literally construct additional buildings around your main one and see your settlement gradually growing, going from a tiny village to a giant fortified town with a dozen of stuff and walls around it, which just looks visually stunning. You are also free to choose what exactly you want to build and focus on, no hard limits and no need to construct ""one of each"" in contrast to predecessor games.
Do you want to make a meme build with ten exactly same buildings generating one same unit type and then just overwhelm your enemy with disposable infantry? Go for it! Are you a fan of strong economy? Fill your building slots with lumber mills, gold mines, quarries, et cetera!
If you enjoy very specific army compositions with only some units of your faction involved, nothing can stop you from playing that way, in fact I'd even argue most armies revolve around picking 3-4 unit types to use effectively while the game offers you 8.

Campaigns are quite fun, as is their manner of storytelling, each mission having a cool short song attached to it. Only 2 factions out of 4 have their respective campaigns right now, unfortunately, but I think they intend to finish other ones in the future, which I'm looking forward to.

What I'm not a fan of and what I'd have personally changed boils down to one single thing that somehow is prevalent in most aspects of the game.
I want more variety, and currently there's not enough to truly call it a masterpiece, although it has great potential.
Here are some examples:
- Artifacts are plain stat increases, it desperately cries for more unconventional items since as of now they mostly increase your attack, defense or resource income. I wouldn't call it a bad system, but it's boring.
- So are hero skills, all characters share same skills that boil down to simple ""melee"" and ""caster"" archetype, while I'd want to see something crazier once in a while. Just anything that can make the system more advanced, really.
- Unit abilities are shared between several factions and mostly revolve around numbers (bonus to attack, defense, buffing allies, debuffing enemies), somehow the game's predecessors were able to have more total units, yet *less* repetitiveness, all abilities felt much more unique and each unit had an identity, which isn't the case here. Make them stand out from one another more!
- More spells of all kinds. Please-please-please! Spellcasting is the game's strongest point, hence develop it a bit more! I want more synergies and more stuff to throw at my enemies.
- Just in general, more variety of content.

Still, it's a good game with a great future, I'm literally hooked. You all should try it too!";55.2;1.0;15.0;274.0;Posted: 16 May

'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is Tarantino's love letter to golden era of filmmaking, 'Songs of Conquest' is Lavapotion's love letter (with fresh ideas implemented) to golden era of 90s turn-based strategies!

It takes best things from classics ('Heroes of Might & Magic', 'Age of Wonders' etc.), adds fresh ideas and mixes everything to receive the best game in the genre.

Songs of Conquest is one of those games that hits a bunch of nostalgia buttons. It has aspects of games like Might & Magic and Master of Monsters, but adds in aspects of newer games like kill shots. I absolutely love how the game utilizes a hex grid instead of squares for movement and has some light town building elements for resources/turn and upgrading units. There is also an active multiplayer and map building community as these tools are already present (and functional!) in game!

The one takeaway I have is the start of the first campaign has a very cringe storyline. I have not made it past map 3 yet, but so far it's seems very murder hobo. Still, I would definitely put this on your wish list or grab it for early access!";3.6;1.0;2.0;545.0;Posted: May 17

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
From the start, this game runs somewhat parallel to the Heroes of Might and Magic games. There's a similar overland map with Wielders (heroes) exploring and moving to points of interest and towns. Towns and mines produce resources needed to upgrade towns and do research. The combat system utilizes the familiar left vs. right hexagonal grid, with stacks of units moving in familiar ways.

The combat system has some added complexity to it compared to the last HoMM titles I played. Positioning serves a critical role, with several spells focused on moving both friendly and enemy troops around the combat map. Zone of control makes a return from the Civilization games; rather than immobilizing your units it presents the enemy with opportunity attacks against your units if they are just walking by, or running away from, the enemy. This serves as a nice feature to prevent ranged units from endlessly kiting melee units around.

The magic system is a little more restricted than I'd like, but it works for the game. During battle, each stack of troops generates a type and quantity of essence (mana) that you can use for spells. This can be abused somewhat, as the amount generated is based on ; three stacks of one troop each will generate three times as much essence as one stack of three troops, although your Wielder starts with a small stack count and must choose to upgrade how many stacks they can command when leveling up.

I'm definitely going to watch the continued development of this game with interest. If you're looking for a newer, more ambitious HoMM, this might be the game for you.";3.3;1.0;5.0;306.0;Posted: 22 May

This game is a worthy successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The developers have successfully transposed this archetype into the modern era with sensible quality of life changes.

The four factions that are currently in the game are very varied and a lot of fun:
- Arleon is the traditional Castle faction with the addition of some mythical faeries. They focus on defensive melee units and ranged damage supplemented by support magic.
- Loth are the Undead/Necropolis faction that combine aggressive armies with zombie resurrection and destructive magic.
- Rana are reminiscent of the Lizardmen from the Warhammer Universe, former frog slaves that break out of their bondage. Their armies are made of melee bruisers and poisonous ranged Shamans.
- Barya are a Middle Eastern faction made of gunpowder units with glass cannon melee units.

Balance for the game is quite good with all factions boasting various strategies and approaches. The magic system based on the units fielded in your army makes a refreshing changes of pace to the spam casting of HoMM3.

in general, game development seems more marketing-driven, very little effort was put into actual game design (even graphic design is questionable)

- there are original mechanics, but judging them is subjective, skipping this. I may say only that spell set which you will you will be limited anyway, so do not expect a variety of ways to play
- graphics is so bad that they had to add a button to highlight interactive objects (in case you take an important object for a pile of garbage). in general graphics and UI is made to look good on a screenshots
- they haven't played first campaign and did not know how difficult the last mission is, had to nerf every enemy in the last mission
- AI is incredibly stupid, keeps attacking your hero every time, it does not matter if it has a much smaller army (even manages to distribute it between all heroes, to it is much easier to defeat two smaller armies in one turn then one big)
- there is no strategy, no way to avoid army losses, you just smash your army into everything, make up for losses and repeat. if you decide to form a range units army there are +75% range protection spell, a lot of units which have 50% range defense and very small battlefield which may be crossed in two turns
- skills are very unbalanced, as an archer you better pray to get +1 range at level 8 then useless +hp
- there is no actual way to speed up animation of units, for heroes you have to click another time to instantly teleport hero to a destination, basically you have to make additional click every time or waste your time

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR polished turd is, unfortunately, still more or less a turd. I'm not hating, but a LOT of reviews for this game are positive only due to HoMM nostalgia. Game has potential, but it's not as ready as some would make you think.

As a longtimed Heroes series fan and someone who was really looking forward to this game I'll be first to say: the spirit of HoMM3 is strong in this one. Even though I'm not a fan of pixelart (HoMM3 sprites still look better than those in this game), I have to admit the level of polish is quite good. Music is especially well made. Base gameplay is solid and you can feel a heart put into creation process.
Should you be rushing to buy this one then? No.

Despite being a small game with pixelart graphics, it struggles with keeping consistent fps even on high end hardware.
Campaigns are short and really not that creative in terms of a plot. Sure, it's a turnbase strategy, but even latest Heroes incarnations could put a good story.
Balance is all over the place, game heavily promotes magic casting, basically forcing you to cast at every possible turn and invest in magic oriented skills. If you won't do so, you'll be blasted to pieces by an AI wielder shooting offensive spells faster than AR-15. Example: in the first campaign you encounter a setup with AI not only starting with more cities (that's expected) but also with a sh*tton of magic resource generators meaning fighting their wielders is a suicide until you patiently try to remove all those external generators first. Or you can simply run 2-3 armies at once into enemy wielder to secure a victory and leave yourself open to attacks from other enemy armies. Fun times. Did I mention that AI has apparently unlimited resources, almost instatly brinding back defeated wielders and coughing up army after army?
Speaking of armies - some units have clear advantages over their counterparts, which you'll discover only a few hours into the gameplay.
Battlefields size is an illusion, you'll get 1 turn to setup your units before an actual engagement and that's if you're lucky. This one might not be a downside for everyone but for me - in tactical turnbased game, it's a huge no-no. If we want things to get fast, we have combat speed and autoresolve for that.
That brings us to buildings. While the whole system works quite nice, some buildings have requirements stating that other, usually rather useless building (e.g. lumbermill) is erected first. The thing is, once you build the building you want, you can simply destroy the required building freeing the space and getting resources back. What's the point here, delaying me 1-2 turns longer?

I'll wait for it to exit EA, then we'll see about changing this review. Good news is - most of problems are a matter of tweaks and adding content, not rebulding the core of gameplay so there's a solid chance the game will come up good.";6.5;0.0;15.0;609.0;Posted: 18 May

Here's my experience in a nutshell:

- Collect nearby resources and build up the town
- Get walled by neutral camps blockading the way out
- End turn until I can build up an army
- Bash my way through neutral camps
- Collect nearby resources and build up the town
- Get walled by neutral camps blockading the way out
- End turn until I can build up an army
- Bash my way through neutral camps
etc.

Combat is extremely simplistic. You sit and wait for the AI to approach and the side with bigger numbers wins. There's two unit types -- ranged and melees. They all play the same. Spells exist... I guess? There's too few of them to really care. None of them impressed me. The wielders are figureheads that don't actually fight which makes fighting enemy wielders not much different than neutral camps. There's just... no variety. No strategy. Just a war of attrition.";1.8;0.0;6.0;82.0;Posted: May 21

I was really excited about this game, which is why this was a hard one to downvote. Unfortunately, this game suffers from a range of bad and DELIBERATE design decisions which sadly make it just a mediocre nice try and a forgettable experience.

Some of the major bad design decisions include:
1) unit stack caps! seriously, what the hell? who ever thought that this was ever even a remotely good idea?
2) no wait and defend in battles, you basically just throw the two armies at each other with close to no strategy
3) the spell variety is severely lacking, and the spells, overall, have negligible impact
4) the artefact system is shallow and it allows for very limited builds; this also means that the best-in-slot items are very clear-cut and that strategically creating an impactful build around the situational needs of the moment is not really an option

I might add more items to this list as I keep playing, however, so far, the above are enough for me to say that this title has completely failed to meet the expectations that it built up by labelling itself the spiritual successor of HOMM3, which could not be further away from the truth. I suppose I'll continue to stick to Horn Of The Abyss.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, I've been waiting for this game for a few years. I've just finished the first campaign and in general it has a few key issues. But let's start with...

The Good:
- Art style is nice. Not the best, but nice. Pixel art is not my thing but models and animations are acceptable. The problem though, due to being pixel art, nothing is too clear (compared to Heroes games, especially Heroes 3). On the adventure map, a lot of buildings are non-descriptive or non-characteristic. But still, they look nice.
- Flow of the game in general is quite good. When you get used to the mechanics, like recruiting units instantly from your other towns with Rally Point or casting unlimited amount of spells per turn is bit different but kinda welcome. The unlimited casting thing has a down side but I'll get to that in a minute.

The Meh:
- Factions are... not very special. Main faction in the first campaign is literally Castle/Haven with a twist. Necros are as expected, skellies and rats. Mercenary faction is pretty bland from what I've seen so far. I think there is also a Fortress faction but I haven't seen much from them yet. They are mostly in the second campaign I think.
- Units are not specifically special either. The game has a unit based mana mechanic, which is different. Each unit has a mana type and they generate that when their turn comes up in combat. Then your hero can cast spells with those mana types (think like MtG mana but creatures generate the mana instead of lands). From what I understand, there are Might and Magic hero types (and we obviously had the Might hero as our main hero in the first campaign) and once again, Might focused heroes suck a bit. More to that later.

The Succ:
- The absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ imbalance, especially in the campaign. Even after the latest patch to balance it out, enemy heroes in the last mission of the Castle faction has almost infinite amount of units. I had to restart the mission twice, took parts of the map inch by inch, lost some parts and tried to retake to lost towns again and again... It took literally 10 hours to finish the last mission. I might've got cancer while trying to finish that last mission.

PS: If you can manage to sneak in your hero to the top leftmost town and kill the guy in front of the town, it's over. But enemy's wandering heroes are literal gods with constantly fully stacked armies, sooo good luck.

- The spellcasting. I mentioned this a couple of times but as different and refreshing as it is, unlimited spell casting becomes absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with Magic focused heroes. You can get hit with 2 Armaggedon, 2-3 chain lightning and a few other fireball-like spells at the same time and lose every single unit while winning. While Magic heroes can do this, Might heroes can... boost troop defences a bit, give a little bit of initiative or grant an extra turn to a unit (which is probably the saving grace of Might heroes).
- Autosave/Battle Save system: After playing Heroes 3 HD+ for years, I really got used to the battle save that let's me replay a battle or take me to the exact moment before I engage the enemy. This game however, doesn't even have a decent Autosave feature. To be fair, it DOES autosave but it usually take you a few turns before, which you need to replay again. I can't even remember how many times I had to replay a ♥♥♥♥ ton of turns just because I forgot to make a quick save. I even had to play a few major battles just because of a simple mistake I made later and forgot to make a manual save. Btw, yes, the game allows you to customize the number of autosaves and autosave frequency in the Options menu but it still doesn't fix anything.

In short... This game has a lot of potential to be a very good one. It may not be a classic like Heroes 3 but it won't be forgotten quickly by the fans of the genre, that's for sure. BUT, I still can't recommend the game in this EA state. It still has a lot of balancing issues and some of the features should be reworked. I'll wait for the full release and if the issues get fixed, I'll probably recommend it then.";15.8;0.0;9.0;868.0;Posted: May 20

Gorgeous art marred by repetitive dull combat, half-arsed, uninteresting magic system and a world-map that trades meaningful exploration for a mobile-like clickathon as you meander from area to area aggressively clicking on whatever interesting sprites are in your way.

I was lured in by the comparisons to HOMM but this has none of the depth. Anyone making favourable comparisons or even stating this is better than HOMM 2/3 has obviously never played them. Songs of Conquest is more like Kings Bounty, albeit simplified.";1.5;0.0;10.0;201.0;Posted: May 16

The game has a great foundation but $30 for a game that is, at this stage extremely unbalanced, has made me regret this purchase. If you like turned based RPG style games, you will play long enough to be disqualified for a refund and then discover the games difficulty jumps from 5 to 10. I did not actually play for 20 hours, I fell asleep and left the computer on, but I would have easily passed the 2 hour mark.

So if you're a HARDCORE GAMER who wants to watch at all the YouTube tutorials just to figure out how to beat the first campaign on ""normal"" difficulty, then this is the game for you.";19.1;0.0;6.0;68.0;Posted: May 17

Basically, what most Turn-Based Strategy purists are saying on their negative reviews.

The game is pretty quick, it seems like the developers have focused more on creating a game that works for streams rather than a complex strategical game. I don't think this issue will be addressed as it's a core problem with the game's foundation.

Con:

- Sadly the most important part (the combat) is shallow and dumbed down. Moreover it gets boring super quick and theres no real strategy involved but pure masses of stacks colliding.
- Limited building / research options
- No voice overs
- ""Story"" seems bland
- Magic is super boring with generic +10 defense spells and dmg spells not being interesting or impactful
- Items boring with only + stats";4.6;0.0;5.0;215.0;Posted: May 19

Not in a very balanced state at the moment. The difficulty curve when you get to mission 4 Death to diplomacy is ridiculous. They have 3 wielders rock up at the same time with armies far greater than you can get just one. Your spells are ""Give your dudes +10 defence"". Their spells are ""Nuke your side of the battlefield"".

I'll give it another go when there's some balance patches. It's a fun game and it has a lot of potential but for now it's completely lopsided.

Edit: Also the auto resolve battle is awful. I send my main wielder into an ""easy"" battle and they get wrecked.";10.2;0.0;3.0;635.0;Posted: May 22

This game had potential. Unfortunately devs decided to throw a curved ball at missinon 4 of first campaign. Which sucks. No matter you do, enemy will allways have upper hand in form of few stacks of rats that will run through entire field and decimate your units and in case of you would survive that you will be bombarded with spells before you can move coz enemy has initiative.
After few hours of tries and restarting last mission im officially done with this game.

Fix last mission and i will recommend it. In todays state, dont bother to play it. Hard game is a hard game, but this game has balnace issues that need to be fixed.";10.4;0.0;4.0;202.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've never played the original Heroes of Might and Magic series so this is legit a fresh look at this game.

It has promise. That's the best I can tell you.

The game comes with 13 maps that you can't edit if you don't want to play the Campaign mode.

If you download maps off of Mod.IO you can't edit them until you go into the game files and copy and past the map file into the file you make for editing maps. No reason for that to be a thing that's a basic function of the map editor why do the maps not go into a folder the editor can read by default?

The AI is terrible. To show off how terrible I had a level 16 hero with a massive army and TWO of the AI's level 3 or less heroes with armies that had absolutely no chance ATTACKED me in one turn. They just ran right into me. The AI in battle prioritizes doing damage and killing units. It doesn't care if it's targeting a unit that isn't a threat it will let your super OP ranged units bombard it and focus on killing weaker units that don't really threaten it. It just cares about dealing damage. That's all.

The Heroes themselves are really unbalanced. A high level caster focused on using the game's magic system can outright destroy entire armies with minimal effort. You can spam multiple spells a turn and it's really, really cheesy. In PVP this can essentially boil down to ""I won because I went first and blew all my spells"" which makes pvp really a moot point.

Some of the spells have wordings that a player could easily misunderstand. If a spell says it damages all Troops it means all troops INCLUDING yours. If a spell says it can jump to multiple troops, it means ALL troops INCLUDING yours. If it gives you two attacks the unit will just blow both if the target survives the first hit even if said target was so mortally wounded it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The spell that pushes things away from you is stopped by the first damage dealing thing the unit is pushed into INCLUDING a CLOUD. Why would I assume the spell that throws a dragon 20 tiles backwards would be stopped by a CLOUD?

To wrap this up the towns also have no real defense at all. They have no baseline defenders and the defense buildings are entirely a waste of time. Defending anything is totally pointless. I ended a game where I attacked the AI's main city and it was being defended by ONE RAT. A SINGLE RAT.

I didn't even know what to make of that.

Long story short the art style is nice, but the gameplay boils down to a random smattering of magic casts against a really inept AI enemy. I understand it's in EA but they want $30 for this game and it's just not worth that in the state that it's in. Maybe some updates will fix that but until that happens I can just review what I have and what I have is not worth $30.";23.8;0.0;10.0;157.0;Posted: 22 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Like someone who had never played the genre before tried to recreate Heroes and Might and Magic 3 based off a description. Plays a lot like classic HOMM games with some modern conveniences, but then just lacks in gameplay depth. Hero upgrade trees are really boring and uninspired (Just straightforward increases to numbers, no new abilities or creative things to do), the idea behind gating larger armies behind hero level is just stupid, especially making you choose between army upgrades and size. In the time I played I found no inspiration to keep playing and exploring the game as it just didn't seem that interesting.

All it really made me want to do was reinstall HOMM 3 and relive the good old days.";3.9;0.0;8.0;259.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I would give this game proper chance, but the thing that killed all my joy is the UI.

I loathe modern games that don’t have proper UI settings. This game has none. Everything is so darn small, that it takes real effort to see text, and clicking requires extra effort. Why is minimap so miniscule? It’s almost useless. Why resource numbers are in font size 6? Why is the troop roster so tiny?

It’s infuriating.

Now, I did not play that much, because I don’t think this game is worth my time at its current state or at the current price tag. Maybe I’ll pick this up on later date at sale, after the full release, if the game gets proper UI settings.

Combat is mediocre plus. I can’t really see myself engaged in it for long run, but it’s alright. I have seen and played much worse. It’s fast which is nice for MP. But it’s also quite simple which can be a good or bad thing, depending on person to person. AI seemed passable. I liked the deployment system of troops at the beginning battles. It felt impactful for the outcome of the battle. Magic system was different, I really don’t know if it was good or bad. Troop limits, well I can’t really say.

Ranged units seemed absolutely overpowered. Wielders (Game’s heroes/commanders) were static boosts, and they felt void and flavourless. Artifacts also felt bland. Campaign apparently is super short or so I heard, which is a bummer.";1.7;0.0;8.0;185.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Eh, there's a decent chance this is the very normal barrier to entry with strategy games kicking my ass, and not as much the game's fault, but it ends up feeling brutally hard very suddenly, and hasn't done a very good job teaching me what the hell I can actually do about it. There is a non-zero chance that, just like XCOM Enemy Unknown made me ragequit and absolutely hate it more than a few times before I learned how to play it properly and it became one of my favorite games ever, that a few months from now I'm going to really hit the vibe and love this game, and this review will be re-written if that happens. Nah, ♥♥♥♥ this game.

The art, music, and general artistry of this game are an absolute home run- this is some good freaking strategy game pixel art: The spooky monsters are are weird and awesome as they ought to be, the background music is immersive and stylish without drawing attention to itself when you don't want it to, there is a HELL of a lot of good game here that I really enjoy. This game has a hell of a charisma.

The Strategy layer is interesting but doesn't feel like a 4x game Brick wall you're at a loss to comprehend, and the tactical-level fights are fun in their own right, a mis-step I've seen way too many strategy games fail at. I start up games, either campaign levels or skirmishes, and I have a blast getting a game on its feet, exploring the map, finding resources, fighting Wild opponents and trying to build my little Empire. That part of the game is , do not under any circumstances come away from this review thinking I don't think there's a good game here, but I play that part of the game, I explore, I enjoy myself, and then my actual opponents show up and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piledrive me into the dirt and I have no idea how they're this strong yet, or how I'm supposed to be able to defend against them on equal footing.

If someone tells you they love this game and will be playing it for the next decade, I would believe them: But that means they somehow figured out how to get past the learning curve, and the game itself is not up to the task of teaching you. The tutorial campaign beat the snot out of me at the end, Skirmishes against the easiest AI crushed me into the dirt at the end, I don't know what the hell else I'm supposed to do to learn this game, because I'm not being taught, just punished for not already knowing how to win.

Edit: Been trying more, and I'm honestly only angrier. Good armies are so much stronger than absolutely anything you can put together on short notice that playing this game is an exercise in just waiting until you learn you're about to loose half your empire because 1 enemy showed up who's ready to actually fight you, and you're just ♥♥♥♥♥♥, no counterplay, no chances, nothing you can do about it. If you get lucky and your good armies are in position when their good armies show up, the game is actually fun. But if your good armies are on opposite fronts, you just burn to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ground together and there's nothing either of you can do to stop it. I rescind the suggestion that it might grow on me: ♥♥♥♥ this game.";11.2;0.0;4.0;151.0;Posted: May 18

Really fun. However, it'll be more fun when modding tools comes into it. Personally, I would like a slightly cleaner UI because it looks rough. The new engine is incredible, It is so much easier to run this than the first game with wayyy more units, amazing (I used to be able to run max 20K in 1 but 1.8 Million in this one). More options for graphics is really good. The aiming is still janky as all hell and a slight incline makes shooting pointless. Aim should always personally be spot on 95% of the time or at least 90% of the time, not 80% as standard. Health points are really weird because soldiers can just rambo through bullet after bullet when in reality, without plates or heavy armour, they can only take 1-5 max before dying. Sound is decent but obviously it's been toned down for rendering purposes so it can sound a little weird but that's really not an issue. Artillery if added in the future should take noise priority regardless for more immersion (possible audio option in the future?). The shooting AI is mostly braindead, rushing into bullets without going prone or taking much if any cover. AI should not have to stop moving in order to attack. Unsure if that's an issue with rendering or not. Grenades for soldiers would be nice. Dynamic health dependant on armour feels realistic and that's great. Attention to detail was a really nice touch in maps and on characters however everyone feels like a clone but again that's probably a rendering feature. a set of 3 versions for each unit with tiny differences would be nice but I don't expect it because of rendering issues potentially. However these are mainly smaller things. The most glaring problem is the ugliest UI I've seen in a game. Other than that it's an incredible game, it feels a little bit like a copy paste with a better engine, but with some new features. added. I'm almost certain this game can thrive.

Well... Every so often a game releases that is so significant, it changes gaming history. Uebs2 could be a generational game.

I have a Nvidia gtx 1080, which is by no means top of the line any more. I can't do anything totally ridiculous to flex on YT... But this game is completely worth the price, just to see for yourself the magnitude of what's been achieved here. I have performance issues running the largest map, but the first time I pitted 2 armies of 4million soldiers each, and to watch that initial crashing together of armies with no lag or choppiness was worth the price alone... I simply cannot explain the scale of 8million musketeers, archers, trolls, and Roman legion soldiers. It's insane. And it's only going to get getter, once modding is enabled and you can do this with Halo marines and Covenant troops, Star wars, LOTR and whatever else. I'm so excited for what this game will become.

Just... Buy the game and see for yourself.

In the chance that devs read comments, I'll comment what i think should be added going forward.

1) Splitting armies. In the first Uebs, you could split a legion of 50,000 troops into 5 sub groups on the set up screen and arrange them on the battle field. This has been taken out. Although we're afforded more armies now, I'd still like to be able to split them up into smaller groups.

2) Also in the army set up screen, a '1' or '2' and the unit type written in the armies box on the minimap so that you can identify what is what and where would be most useful.

3) With ridiculous scale battles going on, and with these battles splitting into 3 smaller battles sometimes, something that highlights where all of team 1/2/3/4 currently are so you can see what units are on which team ingame would be a great addition too.

4) RTS has 6 options but nowhere does it say what any of them do. A hover thing could appear if you leave the mouse on an option to tell you.

5) Map creator and the ability to share maps to the workshop would be fantastic. Alongside the unit creation.

My thoughts.";22.9;1.0;5.0;39.0;Posted: 17 May

Great Game and mostly because I played UEBS 1 since it came out.. The mechanics seem to work better and it is far better optimized that allows more units and bigger battles without the issues of killing your GPU. So far I'm liking the game but I still finding myself going back to #1 only because of the multitude of units and the mod workshop that put the first one better than this version... Even though I like the game better I am not sure its worth the money until they bring it up to par with the first edition with more units and the ability to mod in game.. Once they hit that point this game will surpass the first one... Since this is early access, I am looking forward to the updates in the future...";11.9;1.0;0.0;61.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The initial settings screen suggested ""Potato"" graphics settings for my RTX 2080 Ti.

10/10, must buy.


On a more serious note though... This game is a technological feat. Every single thing runs on your GPU, not just the graphics. Just had some fun in the sandbox mode. Creating a few custom ""God characters"" vs. 2 million german soldiers. Seeing millions of NPC's surrounding my little group of ""heroes"", while watching millions of bullets soar through the sky. All that chaos, while keeping a decent FPS is a miracle.

The flow-physics of the blood and gore are a fun addition. Try to create a red Nyle of blood is a fun goal to aim for in sandbox mode xD

I hope the developers will present the technology behind this in a GDC conference sometime in the future. I'm very curious to see the shader tech behind this.";1.1;1.0;0.0;192.0;Posted: May 17

Great fun so far, definatly in a solid playable state unlike alot of early access titles - no crashes or bugs so far atall.

Devs - here's some things i think would really improve gameplay if your looking for feedback :)

move to area: select troops and select an area on the map for them to fill (currently only move to a point making moving formations of troops difficult).

more camera speed: big maps take forever to navigate

jump to unit option: move camera to a unit.. currently they can be hard to locate

spawn and delete units during gameplay

more time controll options

steam workshop for maps and characters; why make your own when uebs 1 had so many modded already :)

weather and time of day options

available unit cap increase: cant scroll after filling page with lots of small units

additional spawn formations: circle, triangle etc";7.5;1.0;0.0;118.0;Posted: May 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've barely touched this game. Literally got it less than an hour ago. However, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it deserves a positive review.

Look, I don't have a top-of-the-line gaming PC. It's decent, no doubt about that, but there's plenty of games I have to play on medium or lower settings if I want smooth performance. I went into this game thinking ""oh, sweet, I never had a chance to check out the first one, and people say this one has even better performance, maybe I'll give it a try."" At that point I was expecting my epic fights to consist of MAYBE 1000 guys vs 1000 guys.

Fast-forward half an hour and I'm simulating an epic battle between 1000 sherman tanks and 1,000,000 spartans. That's right, ONE. MILLION. Not only that, I was running it on high graphics settings, and my fps never dropped below 30. I don't think I've ever had one million of anything on this PC without it instantly exploding.

TL;DR: 10/10, would watch 100,000 chickens body 100,000 spartans again.";5.9;1.0;1.0;209.0;Posted: May 19

The game is still in early Alpha, but is surprisingly stable on my rig! Most of the performance issues are sorted out and really well optimized! I know quite a few people have had some issues with battles not loading, and game crashes, and I wish you all best of luck and hope those issues are resolved quickly. Personally, I have never had a single issues with the game not loading or crashing, so fingers crossed for the future!

Quite a few features are still missing, but the devs made it very clear on release what this game was, and for being alpha, it really just lacks features from the first. I've seen quite a few reviews of some complaining that loads of content is missing and all you need to realize is that it's in ALPHA. that's PRE-BETA, EARLY stages of development.
I was able to get 30 million units running on my 3090, oh what a glorious sight it was (and impressive, too)! To see every little spec move in a fluid motion, to watch swords clash and projectiles hot(and miss), it truly is a game for battles of cinematic scale, and I'm sure UEBS 2 will be the benchmark for RTS performance in the next generation of RTS games.

It's far from complete, but has great potential. I look forward to all the future content updates, more maps, units, modding, and maybe even air/naval units. UEBS 2 truly is a technological marvel to behold, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a glimpse of next-generation RTS and simulators.

TL:DR
If you're looking for a complete game with modding support, and completely free of bugs, some even game-breaking, then this is not for you. Not yet, at least.

If you're looking for a game that is an amazing proof-of-concept, and shows the true power of what a modern GPU can really do. If you want to see the battles you only dreamed of as a kid, on modest hardware, then this game IS for you.";7.4;1.0;0.0;328.0;Posted: May 18

Surprisingly good framerate for an early release. Ran everything at high settings on rtx 3080ti and ryzen 7 5800x With STEADY 60fps (This was with like 200000 units spawned in as well). The game looks better and runs better than the last game. Would love to see the return of the speed up/slow down slider. The AI has seemed to improve a little as well. Some maps have several areas that units will get stuck in or have no access to I.E. in the city map there are buildings that can't be entered. Great potential here.";1.1;1.0;0.0;88.0;Posted: May 17

The piles of corpses are now taller than the surrounding rock formations. but alas, it is not enough to completely paint the downstream water reservoir with blood. ultimately epic indeed!

The game runs about 2 to 3 times better than the old game so far as fps. But the amount of active npc's on the field is vastly improved. On the old game 100k soldiers meant 1 fps. On the new game the same machine can run 1 million soldiers at 15 fps. So it's way more playable. And runs very smooth. What I don't like so far, Are the maps. Every location has multiple entrances, And in a zombie invasion scenario, This just won't do. I like to pit a small midieval army against a horde of zombies, In a castle type location. And block in my foot soldiers with archers so they can't run out and get killed too fast. And I can't do that if i have a dozen holes to plug. I'm hoping that they add maps that are more usable for this type of game.";20.1;1.0;37.0;72.0;Posted: 16 May

I didn't even know there was an UEBS1 let alone an UEBS2. I came across this game quite accidentally within my Queue.
Curiosity got the best of me so I checked out the videos and the reviews. Then I decided that for about $20 bucks it was worth a try. I must say that even though this title is an Early Access Game it's fun to play. Sure it's limited with what you can do, but it it has so much potential. I really hope that Brilliant Game Studios follows through with the final development of this game. Between them and the community there is an opportunity to really make something unique here.
The sandbox mode is the only thing you can play around with currently. Even with the limited characters that you can use you can still have fun adjusting the size of the armies and create different scenarios. Speaking of which, just make sure you meet the minimum requirements to play this game otherwise your rig will have a hard time processing extremely massive battles. This game is decently optimised and is almost like running a benchmark when you play it. Even a high end PC will be pushed to its limits if you let it. ""Yes"" the battles can be that large.

Just be aware that UEBS2 is still an Early Access Game and it has its share of bugs. Some are having problems in getting the game to load. Also, if you get bored easily then you might want to avoid this game in its current state. But the way I see it is boredom easily sets into the boring mind. As for me this game will be a good addition to my library because it's a blast to watch the battles unfold and command different strategies. Especially when you have a million battle ducks fighting a hundred thousand zombies. You're about to get ducked! Cheers!";11.7;1.0;0.0;427.0;Posted: May 16

This game improves a lot the last one lacked. Better AI, more troops on screen, slow mo, RTS mode and more. This delivers so much for an early access game. Highly recommend for those who enjoy a casual, sit back, what-if scenario game.";5.4;1.0;0.0;43.0;Posted: May 16

Its solid so far and runs much better but I think of the first one as a proof of concept. This game (the 2nd) should improve on everything the first game did and ultimately add all the cool stuff. A few objective based battles, (Kill the leader, take a position, protect the president idk)

Add more god powers because they're cool, add customizable stuff. Change the color of bullets or arrows being shot. Maybe a map maker, workshop sooner rather than later. Also maybe add map random events that can sway zerg battles.";4.7;1.0;4.0;280.0;Posted: May 16

Game is newer than I realized. This is the most Early Access Game I've ever heard of, Not much content here right now and the game will keep you playing for a while but it still feels incomplete in most aspects of the game such as the sherman tank, ww2 soldiers, and pretty much every characters fighting.

The game does seem to have a very promising future ahead of it and with mod support I can see lots of players coming to this game.

I also think they should add the workshop to this and more customizability
They should have a weapon creator and have the characters equip things instead of being forced to use it
also some more weapons they should add are:
grenade launcher
rocket launcher
Pistol
Fists
Double Barrel Shotgun
M16
Mp5
Ak47
(random Melee weapons)
Gatling Gun
Sniper Rifle (it should have a stupid amount of range)

And should Add enemies Like:
Terrorists
Russian Soldiers
Police
Swat Police

It is early access build when I am writing this so a lot is probably going to change. I am really excited about this game and whats to come. They only thing that bothers me is the footmen models. I would like it if they got more diverse for example some of them have cloaks, some have chainmail, some don't have helmets, some have different types of helmets, and it would be cool for more weapon types like maces and axes. Other then that the game is amazing but still has many bugs like the RTS mode bugging units so they cant move and they get stuck on each other a lot and then stop moving completely. The there are 5 HUGE maps and 13 units right now. The battles can get boring some times with little variety in units but it still is very fun even with only 13 units to choose from. I had 3000 spartans fight 1000000 persians and still got a crispy, tender, 50 fps.";6.0;1.0;0.0;58.0;Posted: May 19

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This review is literally days after release so much of what I say here could be rendered moot over time.

However it's a grand improvement over the first due to some changes in optimization, allowing less lag and stuttering. I don't understand how, but I think it just puts the pressure more on your graphics card than... whatever it was before which is actually a good thing (if you have a decent graphics card). I only played about 30 minutes of the first one but I dumped six hours into this one, four of which was a singular battle in the massive City of Troy, emulating a three-way siege battle that I played like an actual RTS. I constantly moved units around, retreated, fortified and reinforced battle units. I just ordered the defensive team around but after four hours and a massive full retreat, my defensive Spartans ultimately lost against the Romans. It was an incredible amount of fun.

I have also had fun administering my own various buffs and nerfs through customization. I think the Roman's and their shields are just too tough as they are, so I gave them a smaller health pool. I found Persians too easily trounced so I gave them some extra stats and increased attack speed. So it gives me a bit of an MMO Tycoon feel to it that I enjoy. I try to make fairly even teams. Or a defensive posture that are outnumbered but can utilize chokepoints. Ever since I learned about the Battle of Thermopylae, I've always been fascinated with the battle tactics of chokepoints and I was able to live that fantasy for four hours last night dealing with it.

So uh, what is the game? It's as the title claims. It's mostly a simulator and you can be as involved as you like, as I mentioned earlier. You just place units on a battle map, load it up and watch them duke it out. You can control a singular unit as well but I've found that they don't perform as well when you're controlling them for some reason. I possessed a troll in a big siege battle and his health drained very quickly. I wandered to a different troll who'd been fighting for a few minutes and his health was still at 95%. So maybe there's just something about a posess-ee that makes the AI prioritize your unit more, I don't know.

So here's what it needs.

1) A scrollbar for more than 18 teams. I like to do micro-management with teams so I like having dozens of teams on the same side. A single platoon with some catapults and archer placements can take 6-8 slots just on their own. We need to have a scrollbar on the setup menu so we can get really micro with it. I imagine it might complicate the color palette but hey... 1b) Let us choose that too! I don't mind all of my Spartan units just being red. I can arrange them as I see fit.

2) I have a discussion thread on this going but oddly, I want smaller maps for smaller-scaled sieges. Including some castles. Maps to come is already a given considering the game is only days old, but wierdly I want to have a map where I can do smaller, Bannerlord-esque engagements. The 300 versus 2000. We don't have castles yet and the closest thing we have is the Mount Olympus but the attacking AI doesn't behave and won't utilize both paths and the defensive posture on that map has a massive advantage. The current setup page even has a notation about how huge the maps are and don't place stuff near the edges, you could do the same thing with the small maps if people try plopping 2million units on a small map you could have those big red letters saying ""Be careful, idiot!""

3) I don't know what the programming capability of this in the game's current engine and state, but I'd -like- to see some better AI. It's not bad at times, I've seen platoons split off when one entrance fight goes on too long and they'll split off to find another entrance. I just feel they ignore some tactics too easily. You can mitigate this to some degree in RTS mode but I still don't fully understand what all of the orders do. I'll try to collect units in one spot only for half of them to split off to attack the enemy regardless of me telling them to hold.

It needs workshop support, more units and more maps and I have no doubt that's all on its way. As it stands, very fun and surprisingly stable.";13.3;1.0;9.0;616.0;Posted: 16 May

A lot of fun for 20 bucks. Pretty crazy how many units you can get on screen at once without it crashing the game. I pitched 1.5 million zombies vs 1000 Nazi's and it maintained 40 FPS at the peak of the battle on a 3080ti and 5900X. Animations are clean for the most part, only a few units are stiff and slightly awkward. Texture detail is great, especially considering how much processing/GPU power is needed to render everything. Game just needs more units and maps which will come when it actually releases.

If you got time to kill and just want to mess around and push your hardware or create hilarious battle moments, check this game out.";1.2;1.0;0.0;160.0;Posted: May 23

This isn't a total war game. This is a game where every single unit has their own AI. No matter how many millions you put on the battlefield. In large battles, the bodies start to pile up. Literally. Every corpse has their own physics and a certain amount of blood that starts to flow according to local topology and pool at low points. You can disable the blood if you really want to, but it's amazing just how realistic it makes a finished battle. The last few units wading through the blood then climbing the hill made from their fallen allies to meet their opponent at the peak.

They pull this off using the GPU, so those requirements aren't for show. They run AI and physics using the obscene parallel processing ability of modern GPUs. As such, even massive battles maintain over 30FPS on my GTX 1650 at ultra 1080p.

I look forward to seeing the roadmap followed, and am excited by the fact there are no firm release dates for the features on said roadmap, which means they aren't crunching to a release date.";2.4;1.0;1.0;276.0;Posted: May 21

The game is definitely fun, being able to have way bigger battles than the first game is awesome. There are some bugs but not a whole lot. You definitely lose a sense of time playing this because of how long massive battles can take. The part that really sucks is the lack of units, maps and modding. Very little units to choose from, same goes for maps. Had there been modding support then this wouldn't be as bad because you could download more units. Just feels like a downgrade compared to the first game, I understand it's in Alpha but they could've at least added in modding support from the get go.

Game is fun, given that it barely came out and is in early access currently. I don't have a decent rig at all, and I can have 500k soldiers on the battlefield and still have 30 fps, which is nice and lets you actually have an ""epic battle.""

There isn't much variety in units so far, for instance Rome only has 1 available type of unit. I'm hoping once the workshop is up, the modders can get to work and make interesting units. The maps are HUGE and the camera speed is really slow at the moment. if you've played any RTS before, this game lacks in some areas, such as you cannot ctrl+A to select all units, so moving units around the map gets tiring. Also, there isn't a minimap you can click to quickly go to a specific part of the field. All in all, the game is still really fun albeit not a load of content. In the future, I'm hoping to see what else the developers can offer to the game!";1.6;1.0;34.0;151.0;Posted: 17 May

I can't believe how many units I can have on screen at a time. I think the most I had was about 2 million, and I probably could have done more. If you're looking for a fun battle simulator sandbox, this one is fantastic. The scale of these battles... I don't think it's been bigger in any other game. This game literally has the biggest battles... ever.

It obviously comes with some limitations. It's not like you can have two million units and have physics simulation across all of them. The graphics are OK but not fantastic, and the unit selection is very limited at the moment. However, the game makes up for it with how crazy large it is. I've made a few custom units too, which adds to the games replayability.

The game is just plain sandbox fun, and if it gets workshop support and/or custom unit support, it'll be a straight 9.5/10 for sure. Solid fun, get it.";11.1;1.0;3.0;580.0;Posted: May 18

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
When the first UEBS was published, i was eagerly seeing where the game would head, the concept was great but execution left much to be desired. The performance was not particularly great, starting to seriously lag even with just a few tens of thousands of troops on the field, even with a fairly decent setup. Overall, the game mostly felt like an overglorified stress test, if anything.


It is saddening to see that the second game is not much better so far. While still in early access, somehow i doubt this will ever be that significant of an improvement over the first game.


Pros:

- The game supports much more troops on field than the first one
- Atleast there is an system for making your troops move to a location...


Cons:

- SEVERE lack of unit variety, if you thought the first game was bad, this is much more so. Most factions only have 1-2 troops, more often 1 than 2. The people are not joking, it's just that bad

- While the unit models are improved compared to the old ones, they still leave much to be desired often

- While you can command troops to move to a position, they will squish to this, awkward shaped formation that is so tight, what the guys in the middle can't move

- There is little else you can do to really control your troops

Overall, this game feels about the same as the first one, an overglorified stress test, that may or may not be worth your money. If you weren't a fan of the first game, this one won't blow you away either. It might, inf act, dissapoint you even more.

Wait and see, don't buy atleast yet.";2.2;0.0;5.0;172.0;Posted: May 17

A total rip off frankly on the back of the first one
After playing the first one i expected an upgrade - this is a massive step back with frankly very little in it at all and virtually no units for example, its barely past the concept stage really

The options are non existent and i cannot even set my key-binds which was already in place in the first one - why would you not simply carry fundamental basics like the the options menu over ?
Id go so far as to say this new version is currently garbage - you've made yourself look greedy and silly.

Frankly buy the first one and you'll get a much better game - this is a total rip off frankly and i bitterly regret buying it, it isn't anywhere near a product that should have been sold and the delays were clearly because they had done nothing on it at all frankly,
I honestly feel genuinely ripped off.
Remember the film Jaws 2 , then think about Jaws 3 and you'll get the idea of what UEBS 2 is at the moment";2.1;0.0;1.0;116.0;Posted: May 18

The underlying engine is fantastic. It'll be really interesting to see where the devs take this. It's just a shame they decided that the editor and the in-game UI were good enough to release. Wait for it to get better before you buy.";13.1;0.0;2.0;283.0;Posted: May 16

Ashamed to say I can't recommend this game in its current state. At the time of writing it's simply the same game as UEBS 1 with slightly fancier graphics. It doesn't even have workshop support!";0.4;0.0;8.0;309.0;Posted: May 16

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, according to this game, my GeForce GTX 1080 Ti is NOT DX 11.1 compatable! I'm running Windows 7 Professional (because I hate Win 10). It says ""DX 11.1 Test Failed!"" Right... It's clearly DX 11 and DX 12 compatable. No battles will run. Not sure what's going on, when every article I can find on that card states that it's DX 11 and 12 compatable. So, looks like a refund is in order.";0.3;0.0;1.0;145.0;Posted: May 18

pretty middle game there are positives as well as negatives. Positive: depends if you want to invest a lot of time into a game and then lose it within a week or a month depending on what server you are playing on the game is over all fun but i dont think it is worth the full price of 60$ if i was you i would wait for a sale. negative: there a lot of raisest people on this game and rude gamers that might make you unable to sleep tonight and other things such as the fear of getting of raided or some one who kills you and then has a laugh at you so these are the positives and negatives these are the things you need to look out for while playing rust so i hope you got a good idea of this game and i hope this helped you make up your mind if you wanted to get the game or not get the game.";166.7;1.0;0.0;19.0;Posted: May 19

This game is fun to play.
There is great graphics and many different things to do in this game.
I have had it for maybe a few years I just dont play to often. It is fun to play for the experience. No matter if you are the builder, the farmer, the pvper. It does not matter there is much to do in this game and it is always fun raiding the people that piss you off. I watch a few youtubers for this game but probably one of the funniest to watch is spoonkid. It is motivating to watch him because he could go from rock to m2 and back to rock and he would not give a single care in the world. Man has been through the toughest parts of this game. When I watch him it helps me realize that this game has a lot of risk value and teaches me how not to stay down but come back for more even if I lost a lot. Maybe this game can teach you some lessons you can take to the real world huh.";92.4;1.0;0.0;45.0;Posted: May 18

PVP servers are fun but kind of a grind, but if you want an amazing experience PVE servers is more fun, if you are a new player start with PVE servers and then play PVP you will enjoy PVE better the community servers are amazing.

I recommend Rust if you just want to vibe and play PVE servers, if you want to be competitive hardcore player go PVP servers options are many...";74.1;1.0;1.0;12.0;Posted: May 19

love the open world feel. pvp is stressful which is fun too. It's a challenging game, which I enjoyed. Imagine Battle Royale Minecraft. But the best part is, you can choose non-pvp servers too if you just want the minecraft feel without the fighting. The music and ambient noise is both immersive and suspenseful at times which adds to the experience. Only downside to the game is that the servers reset periodically, which means you lose your progress, even on casual non-pvp servers.";82.0;1.0;0.0;29.0;Posted: May 19

This is a mature and adult content game. Would recommend it for adult gamers. Frustrating, maddening, and rage-inducing, while fun and interesting. The Building and functional detail of the game is amazing. The individual player avatar animations could use some work, they are very basic, and there is no ability to lay prone.";783.2;1.0;0.0;122.0;Posted: May 21

I absolutely recommend playing this game if you're still deciding if you should or not. Is the game super toxic? Yes. Are you going to get door camped? Yes. Will large teams roll you as a solo player without a second though? Absolutely.

Rust is a love hate relationship, when you're having a good wipe it's amazing. When you're off to a bad start and can be a long up hill struggle. But play it anyway, it's worth it.";951.8;1.0;0.0;62.0;Posted: May 17

Have you ever wanted to play a survival game with base-building and pvp?
Do you like getting your eardrums annihilated by someone else's war crime of a microphone?
Do you, too, wish to relive the experience of Xbox parties circa 2009-2012?
If you answered yes to 2/3 of these, then this is, probably, the game for you.

I always have fun playing this game because of the exploration and first-person experience aspects, it is amazing to just hang around. The multiplayer combat is incredibly fun, regardless of the level of social skills, or lack thereof, in people you ""meet"" under ""friendly circumstances."" It's a blast. The base-building and resource gathering is also highly enjoyable since there is a lot to do and learn. Learn how cook. Learn how to smelt. Forge meal. Forge a weapon. Forge a girlfrie--wait that last one is not on the list.

Point is: you will love this game if you want the true Naked and Afraid Experience (TM) because, let's be honest, someone will kill you almost the moment they see you in many, many situations (especially if I am trying to steal their resources--you can not stop me random person I will never see again).

Anyways, thank you for reading my review if you have stuck around this long, if you could not already tell through my masterful levels of subtly, I like this game.";144.7;1.0;0.0;51.0;Posted: May 21

If you want to play Rust, you have to play over 100+ hours to get a decent sense of everything the game has to offer. From the highs, lows, trolls, raids, death to animals when you're first starting out, door camps, and other fun stuff that will happen. Just stick through it with a buddy, and you'll be good at the game and understand whats's going on in about 1,000 hours!";2575.1;1.0;0.0;34.0;Posted: May 22

An open-world multiplayer game with one catch... complete and total anarchy.

In my opinion, this is Rust's greatest strength and it's greatest weakness. You start with nothing and progress by gathering resources, building a base, crafting weapons/armors, etc. However, your interaction with the other players is what makes Rust special, as it can keep the experience from getting boring and provides incentive to improve at the game.

Because players can do what they want, anything can happen and THIS is what the game is all about. The game is centered around player conflict, but alliances can be indirectly formed with other players.

Rust can be the most brutal, but also the most rewarding game if you invest the time into it. That being said, I do recommended the game to others, ***so long as you know what to expect going into it.***

What to expect:
- You will die A LOT. Because of the nature of the game, everyone assumes you are a threat before anything else and will kill on sight most of the time. Other players are just toxic... get used to it. This makes it tough to get started but it gets better with experience.
- Your default should be: DO NOT trust anyone. There are some genuinely kind players out there, but weeding out scumbags is a skill itself that can be developed.
- Your base can be destroyed by other players. You'll learn to recover quickly and get back up and running when this happens. With time and practice, you can be the one dishing out the carnage.";2082.0;1.0;0.0;147.0;Posted: May 16

Joined a new server and woke up on the beach. First thing I saw, ""You died to (player), bolt-action rifle, headshot, 150m"".

Respawned, woke up to two guys running up to me demanding I drop my rock, AKs pointed at me. Suddenly, ""You died to play, AK, headshot, 2m"".

Respawned again, smacked a tree, got my leg chewed off by a bear, died.

Fourth time's the charm, I thought.

""You died to (player), bolt-action rifle, headshot, 151m.""

I click a button to wake up.
I meet a person.
He kills me
He starts talking
""You're trash kid, eat my puss* ♥♥♥*ot.. eat my puss*.. Get ♥♥♥♥ on.. Eat my puss*""

Avoid.
It's not a game, it's a front for numerous skin gambling websites for minors.
it's malware that runs crypto mining programs in the back ground.
It's an un-optimised mess with severe memory leaks.

Instead of adressing these ''issues'', Facepunch just keeps adding more useless transport options (Cars, ziplines, Trains) that become obsolete as soon as the novelty wears off.

No character creator.
The game just hands you a randomised character. (in my case: a bad cgi bald asian lady)
Apparently, wanting to play a toon that resembles yourself irl makes you a racist according to Facepunch.
The main reason facepunch turned off ''family sharing'' is that they want you to keep buying the game on alt-Steam accounts until you get the character you like.

It's a scam and it shouldn't be allowed on Steam.";163.4;0.0;0.0;3.0;Posted: May 17

running the game to ♥♥♥♥; every update makes it worse and i honestly don't recommend buying it in the state it's in right now. They constantly make the game less pvp oriented and i sit on my phone for a good 2 hours every wipe because of how boring it gets. If you're more into pve then i'd say go for it, but ark is probably a better option in the survival/pve category. It also has some pay-to-win aspects like the winter hazmat suit (not much.) Vanilla servers take long, boring, job like days to get a satisfying experience and modded is full of corrupted admins that ban you for even showing the slightest amount of skill

The best way to explain my feelings on this game is through a story. So this monster cockroach had taken up residence in my bathroom for like the last year but whenever I tried to catch him he would always slip my grasp. About a week ago I finally corner the bastard in a cartoon box. I find a way to maneuver the roach into the toilet without wasting any time, and a sense of victory washes over me. But is this enough? Oh hell no I want this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to suffer. I decide I'm going to drop a load on him before I flush him, a dishonorable sendoff. So I get on the toilet and start going to work. It starts coming out and this is one solid log I had been holding on to for about half an hour I aim by looking through my legs, all is going well, the log is right on coarse. Eventually it makes contact, and this is when all hell breaks lose. The roach goes full rambo and climbs UP MY ♥♥♥♥ towards my butthole! I panic and start jumping around like a 50's housewife who just spotted a rat. Mind you my log hadn't been broken yet so I'm spreading that ♥♥♥♥ all over the bathroom in the process. Best part? The little bastard got away. Now I'm sitting on my computer procrastinating cleaning my bathroom covered in fecal matter.

While I enjoy the game I have several complaints. For one, most players aren't good at the game they either hack or abuse every aspect. The worst aspect is the constant trolling when it is clear you lose a PVP from connection issues or the administers not stopping the cheaters. The game itself is great when it works. It is other people though that ruin the experience. It also is difficult to acquire items early on like guns or explosives to compete. It takes way too much time to get used to the game.";986.5;0.0;0.0;4.0;Posted: May 18

Too many scripters and hackers. For a full loot game things like this are more detrimental than normal. Having both recoil and bullet spread at the same time only adds to the ease of script advantage while also making the skill curve far less friendly for newer players. It's a game with a lot of potential but falls short when it comes to combat, gunplay, and anti cheat.";1319.7;0.0;0.0;65.0;Posted: May 22

Where could I even start? Rust is made by the same company as Garry's Mod, which if you know anything about what hot garbage that game is you can already expect Rust. It's unresponsive, dated, the anticheat doesn't do anything. Ignoring all those fatal flaws, the core gameplay centers on building a base and stockpile of gear in order to even play. How this works is unless you play the hour a server resets (wipes) it is just you with middling melee vs dozens of guys with guns who will hunt you to the end of the earth even if you have nothing, because they enjoy the kill. It's a great game for unemployed sociopaths and streamers (same thing).";14.0;0.0;0.0;153.0;Posted: May 20

At first the game seemed like it could be a fun time, It can be pleasant if you join a quieter server or something. The larger public servers have vastly devolved into just people keeping themselves locked to primitive tech and killing newbies off of spawns, It's rather depressing. If you don't have a group, you're better of finding a solo/duo server, the public ones are just awful to play on. For how many bows there are, why can I not make a wooden or metal shield?

Many of the players in the chat are very homophobic, yet will constantly brag about how ""deep"" they went in on boys, the irony is palpable. The chat's on many servers are barely moderated and I can understand, If I read half of the stuff these idiots post on a daily basis, I'd want to die more than I do already.

The fishing is 10/10, it's chill if you do it in a safe zone, It's a great way to wind people up who want to kill you by refusing to leave and fishing for like an hour until they get bored.";80.4;0.0;0.0;295.0;Posted: May 19

CS:GO is pretty good, I don't know how I feel about the Competitive matchmaking however, the toxicity is quite terrible. In my overall opinion, the rating would go something like this;

Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics Quality: For a 2012 game, 8.5/10
Controller Support: from my experience, pretty bad. 3/10
Online Service: 10/10
PC Requirement: Decent
Streaming Support (Nvidia, Cloud, etc.): 8.5/10
Online Interaction: If they're not Russian, they're usually okay. 7/10
Weapon Balancing: About as good as a 6v6 counterterrorism game gets. 7/10
Cheaters: You must buy Prime Status. 0/10

Overall: 6.5/10
The game is good, the only thing is that if you want to gain XP, Ranks, Crates or anything else from Drops, or play with genuine players not cheaters, you must buy Prime Status. It's price is worth it, but it's still money.
The matchmaking could do with improvement, so could the Rank Skill range.

It's definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of Rainbow Six Siege or Valorant.";106.2;1.0;0.0;52.0;Posted: May 16

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.";152.9;1.0;0.0;0.0;Posted: May 19

So far I love the aspects of the game, just wish there were less cheaters I have been coming across a lot of them lately which kinda turns the game down for me, especially when I have prime match making and high trust factor based on what it takes to get a high trust factor I have done. I look forward to getting better and eventually moving to FACEIT and ESEA to get away from cheaters and better myself at the game.";12.5;1.0;0.0;1.0;Posted: May 22

It's honestly a great game. I feel like there are some bugs and things that need to be nerfed, buffed, patched etc but that doesn't ruin the game. However, what does ruin the game are the countless cheaters. I don't know if it's just me but every Wingman 2v2 I play ends up in a loss by someone (mostly russians) who seems fairly unlegit in game, in profile.";790.2;1.0;3.0;20.0;Posted: 18 May

An incredible game, with a great history which is entangled with my soul. I used to be playing CS since the 1.6 version. Great and eye-catching features are added to the Global Offensive version including the new agents and guns being updated once a while, great stickers, play modes, challenges, etc. The game really conveys a sense of enjoyment, satisfaction and attraction in a world of artificial reality. However more efforts are needed to avoid cheaters violating the rules of the game. So grab you gear and let's go!";1588.6;1.0;0.0;1.0;Posted: May 18

CS:GO is solid multiplayer fps game with lot's of weapons and maps.
It's been ten years from it's release in 2012 but it's still the most popular game you can find on steam and are still lot's and lot's of players are still playing it maybe because it's free it has an excellent performance maybe they want to have a good time playing it with they're friends or they might just want to learn some Russian for free.
I personally think they might need to update they're anti cheat system.
But if we ignore this this might be the best game you will play.";1062.0;1.0;0.0;0.0;Posted: May 21

I had a friend that picked up his PC and threw it on the ground because we lost a game on Dust 2...

This smart move ended up breaking his graphics card and mother board, since we were all young at the time and he didn't have a job to be able to afford a new computer we never really saw him come online again.

Not sure what he is up to nowadays but I wish him well.

Also I would probably rate the game a 5/10.";828.2;1.0;26.0;426.0;Posted: 22 May

Some jagoff has been botting in flying scoutsman literally nonstop for two weeks. He'll join with a posse of bots which will kick all human players and then sit there so he can headshot them. It's the only non-prime scoutsman lobby in my region, and it's literally unplayable. Devs are evidently too busy leaking their source code to do anything. But it's a good game bro, if you pay $15 you can get an ugly ass gun skin once a week and maybe you can even play the game, who ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ knows dude";18.4;0.0;2.0;80.0;Posted: May 22

The worst gaming community... 8 out of 10 games are filled with cheaters of all kinds... every game shows how useless is to put hours into this game and specially you will never rank up in solo matchmaking either because of the cheaters, of because the game is so dead that you queue up with people 3/4/5 rank above you. I strongly recommend that people avoid this game. Worst scam in all of gaming. All of the game mechanics is basically based on skins trade. The best example how to destroy a good game.";2099.0;0.0;0.0;62.0;Posted: May 19

The game I loved is dead.

Valve care more about skin revenue than fixing ranked competitive matchmaking. It's littered with smurfs, cheaters, and rank mismatches so egregious as a silver that it's impossible to solo queue anymore. I've been playing for two decades, I can tell when a person is a higher skill level than me, and the number of apparently GOD-TIER AIMERS ONE RANK HIGHER THAN ME is completely incomprehensible. Not to mention the sheer number of games I've played against MG, MG2, DMG, LEM, over and over and over again.

Garbage for new players. ""Trust based"" matchmaking, meaning new player = only meet hackers. Voicechat is never in English. Midway through doing my placement matches I got a 24 hour cooldown for ""being reported for greifing more than most players"" because I was being put against bad players in my first few matches, and that means I must be hacking so I got mass reported! Dont get me started on the really loud antwerp livestream popup after every game. If you didnt start playing around 5 years ago dont bother starting.";10.3;0.0;0.0;1.0;Posted: May 23

This is the only game I can't play on my laptop! I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ furious! Whoever made this ♥♥♥♥ is either a pretentious bumbling moron or is deliberately throttling certain setups! It's unacceptable in this day and age that a company raking in billions can't make a stable game that's equally accessible to mid-range priced rigs as well as those on the high end. I'm not stumping up 3000 euros for a rig only to be able to play this game casually, just to relax every now and then, and not want to smash my laptop every time I turn the game on. 16GB ram, 6GB video memory, RTX 3060 GPU, i5-10500H CPU, 500 SSD and still not enough to fire up this game and enjoy a stutter-free experience. JUST NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SENSE THAT I CAN'T PLAY A NORMAL MATCh WITH THESE SPECS! We're talking Counter-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-Strike, tiny 2D maps and cheap aged VFX effects, you stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!

The Fire Spirit card is unlocked from the P.E.K.K.A.'s Playhouse (Arena 4). It spawns a very fast, area damage, short-ranged Fire Spirit with low hitpoints and moderate damage. It resembles a small chunk of flaming coal. Fire Spirit launches itself at its target when attacking, destroying itself on impact. It is the same as those spawned by the Furnace. A Fire Spirit card costs 1 Elixir to deploy.

The Fire Spirit's area damage is very useful against swarms of weak, small troops like Goblins, Spear Goblins or Minions. However, due to its relatively low health, placing it next to these units will result in it dying before it can attack. Placing the Fire Spirit at a distance allows it to safely deploy.
Against the Mother Witch, you want to place it close to her instead, so that it is killed as part of its attack instead of being killed by the Mother Witch, otherwise she will spawn a Cursed Hog from it.
If timed correctly, a Fire Spirit can damage all the Lava Pups just as they explode from the Lava Hound, defeating them.

Due to this splash, an effective strategy is to pair it with troops that deal high single hit damage but are easily stopped by the small troops mentioned, such as the Mini P.E.K.K.A. and Prince.

The Fire Spirit will connect to a Princess Tower provided it is equivalently leveled. Although it can easily be stopped, its cheap cost often lures out cheap spells and can cause opponents to over-commit Elixir-wise with their defenders. If used at the start of a match, it can also act as a way to tell what deck your opponent is using based on the card that they use to stop the Fire Spirit.
Fire Spirit can compliment pushes effectively due to its good cost-to-damage ratio and fast movement speed. For example, if the player is pushing with a P.E.K.K.A. and Fire Spirit behind and the opponent drops Minions to counter for example, the Fire Spirit drops the health of said units to be finished off by a Zap or cheap ranged units to protect the P.E.K.K.A, letting her continue towards the tower without taking extra damage.
It is most effective with fast moving troops like the Hog Rider, as they will not collide with each other as much during an attack.
A Hog Rider and Fire Spirit combo can make short work of Cannons.
The player can use units to soak it up. For example, the Skeletons or another spirit result in a neutral Elixir trade.
For more Fire Spirit value, a Furnace costs 4 Elixir and can spawn up to 7 Fire Spirits, giving the player almost twice as many Fire Spirits for their Elixir. It can allow for more consistent chip damage to Crown Towers and can bait spells due to its cost. However, the Fire Spirits do not spawn all at once, and its upfront cost is higher, so in a situation where the player needs quick area damage, the Furnace is much less versatile.
Occasionally, it is a good idea to combine the Fire Spirit with spells to defeat certain troops for a low Elixir cost. With a Zap, it can defeat anything up to Wall Breakers, with Arrows, it can defeat anything up to Skeleton Dragons, with Fireball, it can defeat anything up to a Night Witch, and with Lightning, it can defeat anything up to an Inferno Dragon. Use these combinations when you are lacking better counters for these troops or to get a good Elixir trade that would be granted compared to using two Spells.
Pairing the Fire Spirit with Electro Spirit is very effective, as they both cost 1 Elixir, which will only use a total of 2 Elixir. This combination can take out units such as Princess, Minions, Archers, Bomber, Firecracker and can even completely stop a Goblin Barrel with the help of the Princess Tower. This combo can help a lot of decks which try to bait The Log or Arrows, since the combo is very effective against swarms. It is also good on the offensive side, having more damage potential than The Log and can hit air. The player should make sure to deploy the Spirits a short distance from their targets to ensure they can finish deploying and attack successfully.
Although the Fire Spirit’s area damage radius is not enough to completely stop a tower-centered Goblin Barrel, there is still a way to counter the Goblin Barrel with Fire Spirit, although 2 of the Goblins will still get one hit on the tower (240 total damage at tournament standard). Place the Fire Spirit on the tile directly behind the tower, and if timed correctly, the Fire Spirit will push one of the goblins toward the tower, and it will one-shot all 3 goblins. This trick is very precise but can be pulled off consistently with practice. A tip for timing: Place the Fire Spirit at the exact moment when the Goblin Barrel is one tile above the river.";22.5;0.0;0.0;30.0;Posted: May 22

Infuriating. The CS:GO Anti-Cheat is pure garbage; It is virtually impossible to go even one day without getting put in a lobby with a hacker. Even if you don't get a hacker, rando teammates usually play worse than the bots; You'll often go spectate someone just to see them stare at the floor or wall. Furthermore, this game is the worse thing to happen to my internet since Spectrum; At least twice a game, everyone will be glitching around because I suddenly have a ping of 240 despite the internet being fine in any other game.
