0;For The Warp;I lean on the side of recommending this game however it seems like something about it makes me both love it and hate it I enjoy the game play and the styling of it makes it enjoyable But I feel like the art or game play just doesnt fit all together Its not terrible but it just seems like its lacking something Like a song without a chorus Feels like its got some good versus and its going somewhere but it just doesnt feel complete  Id definitely keep this game on deck if youre on the fence about getting it but if you feel like scratching an itch for some card battling then maybe this will be your scratch post;0.4;1.0;0.0;816.0;30 March, 2022;False;614

6;For The Warp;2021 Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I have decided that im am going to try and get myself more involved with card games like this one i received the product for free after hearing from a friend that he got it and rather liked it and very glad that i did First of all the art style i love it gotta say though i am a sucker for pixel art the music is very good as well and the game play is solid how it flows from map to battle sequence back to map Id have to give this maybe a 8/10 and its still in early access so it can only go up  Here is a video i made on it please note its a first impression video NOT a review;20.2;1.0;0.0;736.0;19 January, 2021;False;631
7;For The Warp; If you like card games that throws balance out of the equation because its single player this games got it all Abuse the game mechanics make tiny decks make one turn kill decks make first turn kill deck make combos that ramp damage to 4 digits no run is the same and they hardly ever turn out the way you want fun times cant wait to see more content;56.7;1.0;1.0;68.0;05 July, 2021;True;350
8;For The Warp; Solid game that scratched my itch for a space battle / deck-building / roguelike mashup This game reminds me a lot of FTL -- but I like what it is a lot better than FTL Gone is the hassle of micromanagement And the pixel art is good I look forward to the future of this game;15.6;1.0;0.0;323.0;14 August, 2020;True;275

13;For The Warp; A great little deck builder with incredible potential Very casual game that lets you lose track of hours with only basic content so far Cant wait to see the improvements that they continue to make;45.0;1.0;1.0;45.0;31 March, 2020;True;197
14;For The Warp; i love this game thx to xisumavoid;21.1;1.0;0.0;50.0;22 March, 2021;True;35
16;For The Warp;Enjoyable deck-builder with nice aesthetics that could use some QoL improvements but still worth the price if youre looking for a new one;6.6;1.0;0.0;197.0;02 April, 2022;False;137
17;For The Warp; A very enjoyable deckbuilder Im a huge fan of Monster Train and this is scratching that same itch The art deserves a shoutout too I love the little details in the ships and stations;7.6;1.0;0.0;3526.0;04 December, 2021;True;182
19;For The Warp; Pros Good core mechanics if unpolished and a bit clunky in execution atm Good play dynamic with the right additions I could see this being something I would heavily play and return to later not sure if it has the full potential of FTL/Slay the Spire but it could depending on further developments  Cons Feels like it has 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards necessary to make it reasonably dynamic Lacks the item variation and customization of Slay the Spire though if you could upgrade to slot more equipment and/or they added basic ship upgrades of some sort Only system variation seems to be enemies no FTL environmental dangers or crew flavor Deck randomization does functionally only reward a small deck  Try it out and hope for things to come;6.5;1.0;0.0;178.0;15 August, 2020;True;736
20;For The Warp; great fun space card game;5.0;1.0;0.0;146.0;09 March, 2021;True;26
21;For The Warp; Already engaging and fun to play The pixel art is really great and what gets your attention right away Despite being in Eearly access I didnt notice any issues and one that I had specific to my machine configuration the developer was fast to fix;1.2;1.0;3.0;437.0;27 March, 2020;True;246
22;For The Warp; The balancing is not on point but the on a casual perspective it is a really nice looking and fun spaceship deckbuilding game;2.8;1.0;0.0;237.0;27 January, 2021;True;126
23;For The Warp; Guide a Rogue Trader hurtling through space in this deck-builder Card-driven FTL combat only no crew or ship management so its very streamlined and accessible Fun but well see how it develops  Please follow my curator page Designer Plays for a truly massive number of concise and honest reviews from a 25-year veteran Game Designer;1.4;1.0;3.0;17122.0;29 March, 2020;True;332
25;For The Warp; For The Warp  Addictive turn based gameplay in a sci-fi setting that is randomized  lovely pixelated artstyle  + fitting soundtrack > winning combination ;77.8;1.0;0.0;668.0;12 May, 2021;True;155
27;For The Warp; What I liked about this game  Yes;32.7;1.0;0.0;232.0;02 February, 2021;True;34
28;For The Warp; Really enjoyable The random generation element makes it pretty cool  The bosses on Galaxy 3 are kicking my ass badly D;12.3;1.0;2.0;254.0;27 March, 2020;True;119
29;For The Warp; Solid deck building space exploration/combat and awesome story;7.7;1.0;0.0;42.0;22 January, 2021;True;63
30;For The Warp; This game is extremely fun even for me someone who is new to this genre The cards in this game are pretty broken so its really fun just to destroy your enemies Most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive My only issue is the last ships deck being drones and shields While I understand its suppose to be a defensive play style it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card I would probably buff the shield cards but its not a big deal Overall a fun game with crucial decision making wits and rng;15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;22 April, 2020;True;564
34;For The Warp; Often absolutely dependent on luck in the first turn without any reshuffle options especially encounters with multiple units not having shield cards usually means game over Most of the battles are about getting enough shield points and stopping the occasional powerful attacks;14.3;1.0;0.0;212.0;05 April, 2020;True;277
36;For The Warp; Excellent little indy FTL style game almost no bugs for an alpha high replayability factor - 301 enemies leveled on my last playthrough;56.0;1.0;0.0;26.0;06 November, 2021;True;136

43;For The Warp; the difficulty spikes need ironing out but so far it is fun;38.8;1.0;0.0;135.0;28 October, 2021;True;60
44;For The Warp; Ive only spent a couple hours in the game but Im loving it so far Great mechanics fun gameplay and interesting locations and enemies Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys either FTL or Slay the Spire Im very excited to see what content there is left to discover and what the devs will change and add in later in the development process My only suggestions would be to add some UI to the in battle screen so we can see things like how much money we have while in battle and and Ui resizing for when the game goes into full screen the game also is a little glitchy at times in battle but Im sure thats something that will get smoother later on Once again definitely a game to grab while its cheap;10.2;1.0;0.0;88.0;29 March, 2020;True;702
45;For The Warp; I found this game to be quite addictive right off the bat Theres not a lot of great science fiction themed card games out there but this one is almost certainly going to be at the top of that list when its done;0.5;1.0;0.0;505.0;03 July, 2020;True;211
46;For The Warp; iTS REAL fun decks build too big if u let it so u gotta skip a lotta card rewards be nice if u could sell cards more but im looking forward to more patches audio and visual lag every now and then and get distorted  but im sure they wil figure it out;9.8;1.0;0.0;74.0;29 March, 2020;True;250
47;For The Warp; Love the draft mode in this game Have had some amazing combinations of cards that were entertaining to play Definitely recommend if you like card-based roguelikes Looking forward to seeing what they add;6.2;1.0;0.0;495.0;21 August, 2021;True;203
48;For The Warp; Like the little brother of Slay the Spire and FTL If you like one of these you will also like this The pixel art is nice the hard combos are fun and the gameplay is very fluid with clear UI and nice feedback The game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature Sometimes the runs are hard sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo both are rewarding Right now the content is still less than FTL and StS but both these game are unusual for the replayability I easily played 10h more than shown here one Steam and still will play more Great game overall;41.7;1.0;1.0;392.0;06 May, 2021;True;566
49;For The Warp; A genuine gem of a game that contends with its likenesses of FTL and Slay the Spire It needs optimization and for the love of god drones need to fire before the enemys turn but I genuinely havent had this much fun in ages Great title;17.4;1.0;0.0;239.0;29 July, 2020;True;234
51;For The Warp; great game had a blast with it;64.4;1.0;1.0;132.0;30 August, 2020;True;31
52;For The Warp; Great game still not the full release version but Im really enjoying my time with it cant wait to see what else gets added;12.9;1.0;1.0;464.0;20 July, 2020;True;123
53;For The Warp; Not much to say yet but its fun;16.0;1.0;0.0;87.0;25 December, 2021;True;32
54;For The Warp; Very good Plays like any good spire type game but has a way of being still very unique and its own game 10/10 even for early access;12.6;1.0;1.0;821.0;04 September, 2020;True;132
55;For The Warp;2020 Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Refreshing to see another Pixel Sci-Fi game Rouge like elements are a lot of fun and I was really into it Made for a good stream   Surprisingly complex and a lot of replayability;3.1;1.0;1.0;873.0;07 April, 2020;False;230
57;For The Warp;10 got released and I couldnt even tell what was new Super unfinished;36.6;0.0;1.0;82.0;03 May, 2022;False;69
58;For The Warp; its really plan and simple for a rouge like in its current state this is a no from me but who knows it might be better in the future;3.8;0.0;12.0;567.0;18 July, 2021;True;133
59;For The Warp; This game has the most  for brains UI design Ive ever seen You can easily reject rewards by mistake by having your mouse too close to the skip button found a mythic card  you You were 1 pixel too far right  Design flaws like that are indicative that a developer is either clueless and has never worked in any real professional capacity or that they just dont care;7.7;0.0;3.0;87.0;02 April, 2021;True;364
61;For The Warp; 2 hours were quite enough to give it few runs to see all the meat Its a nice concept but many aspects of it still requires quite much polish More like no than yes wish there was a neutral option on steam for review system;1.5;0.0;2.0;581.0;26 January, 2021;True;222
62;For The Warp;Internet Dependent  bug in the middle of the game because of that this Sux;22.2;0.0;3.0;382.0;30 April, 2022;False;74
63;For The Warp;Shallowly fun but little depth Some card combinations are straight up broken and now everything except that feels bad to me  Also VERY repetitive;15.8;0.0;2.0;158.0;31 March, 2022;False;145
66;For The Warp;Just far too little content too few cards just boring;3.1;0.0;3.0;396.0;02 April, 2022;False;53
67;For The Warp;The game is ok but the total randomness of the cards really detracts Starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships If you encounter multiple 3 ship groups in a row you just plain lose The damage output balance is very weak It feels like a beta game Drafting is cool but way over powered compared to the base decks;63.2;0.0;5.0;70.0;06 April, 2022;False;364
68;For The Warp;This is a tentative thumbs down Beat the game on my second or third run when I realized you sometimes just get an amazing equipment like permanent +1 energy right at the start of the game and its essentially a free win Lots of unbalanced cards and strange design decisions doesnt quite have the replay factor or the alternatives Slay the Spire Monster Train heck even FTL Fun quick little game with quite a few cards which surprised me but no balance or satisfaction for a lot of events Very repetitive I love the art style but the execution is bland Id probably rate this a 65 or 7 out of 10 at the moment;9.2;0.0;1.0;156.0;01 April, 2022;False;606
70;For The Warp;I thought theyd fix the problems the game had in early access They didnt Poor game balance primarily;6.4;0.0;8.0;278.0;29 March, 2022;False;100
71;For The Warp; 2 things before we begin 1st even though this is a negative review i still enjoy the game and will probably change this review after a few patches 2nd This is the edited version  This game is far to RNG heavy and i think it could be fixed with 1 of 2 things Either give us the power to build a deck by removing or adding cards to your deck even if it is just at the start of the sector Or give us a bigger choice of cards at the start of each Sector My reason for this is simple they is no way of forming a complete build besides random luck  All that said I did have fun playing and will keep playing but I suggest you wait for a few patches to come out before you buy the game;11.3;0.0;2.0;306.0;30 March, 2020;True;679
72;For The Warp; Game is short and rather shallow Only 3 ships and 5 levels at this stage  Update 4 ships and 6 levels I dont hate this game and will continue to play and update reviews Still not recommended at this stage;8.6;0.0;8.0;168.0;14 July, 2020;True;205
73;For The Warp; This game is far too barebones currently There is no real meaningfull synergy The best way to beat the game is to simply remove cards from your starting deck so that you can fill it with cards that cost 0 and draws 1 It has cards that are too strong like reversing all enemy intents for 0 energy It becomes more of a war of how much time do you wish to spend on the save rather than how great of play do you do and how interesting of a deck you can build and due to that there are never any exciting moments where you live on a sliver of health You can tell from the first three battles if this run will be worth doing or not Its not totally meaningless but it would need quite the rehaul to make it worth playing more than once let alone pay for it;7.1;0.0;8.0;123.0;07 February, 2021;True;750
77;For The Warp;The game-play is pretty boring for now 5 hours to kill all bosses with second ship on Normal mode and 90% of the time there were repetitive boring fights I expected more variety;5.9;0.0;3.0;104.0;29 March, 2022;False;177
78;For The Warp;This game is a -HUGE- slog  Enemies have so much hp and the gameplay is so incredibly dull and unengaging that I could never recommend this to someone;4.2;0.0;6.0;1042.0;03 April, 2022;False;150
81;For The Warp; with each update the game gets harder and harder to the point if you dont get a heal card at the start even on normal you will lose your taking away any options for the game with less healing or shields;51.3;0.0;5.0;318.0;19 February, 2021;True;203
83;For The Warp; broken game;2.7;0.0;2.0;49.0;21 February, 2021;True;12
84;For The Warp; Its an intriguing entry in the card-battle genre but I was disappointed to beat it on the first try I had a card that gave shields and HP for just 1 energy and doesnt get removed from your deck so I was basically invulnerable  In general it doesnt feel like much effort has been spent on card balance Id recommend getting Slay the Spire Monster Train or Griftlands instead;2.8;0.0;2.0;349.0;12 May, 2021;True;373
86;For The Warp;Really nice on the surface concept artstyle musicthe first few runs are really fun  I really wish I could give a reccomendation but its very unbalanced and repetitve Either you get the right aka broken combinations of cards/upgrades at the beginning easy win Or you dont then its almost a guaranteed loss  Also some qol improvements would be really nice clear indicators for active powerups or status effects support for 219 resolutions etc  Changes from the early access version are almost not noticable except the new cards Would love to love it but cant as it is right now;17.1;0.0;5.0;111.0;02 April, 2022;False;575
87;For The Warp;Its quite boring;1.5;0.0;2.0;353.0;29 March, 2022;False;16
88;For The Warp; This still feels like its in early access and could use some work before its set At the moment the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions Most of the cards you get also just dont see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - theyre just small numbers boosts a lot of the time The idea has potential overall and its possible a future version will make notable improvements but its currently hard to recommend over the other deck-builder games available on Steam;2.5;0.0;5.0;919.0;09 February, 2021;True;511
89;For The Warp;Like other negative reviews power scaling is strange and basic survival past the first round or two seems to be based on luck if you get shield capacity and energy The battles are long and enemies are mostly uninteresting You just slug away at each other taking turns recharging shields and taking shots For the price I think there are many other better deck builders but its not awful The art and theme are very well done;10.5;0.0;7.0;441.0;06 April, 2022;False;422
92;For The Warp; How are you supposed to beat a cloaked boss that cant be targeted WTF;126.1;0.0;4.0;50.0;10 November, 2021;True;70
93;For The Warp; This needs a good deal of work It has a lot of promise but being so close to release and still so buggy and looking so fuzzy/hazy at times This feels like a mobile game that is getting tested first through Steam and feels like it at times The aesthetic is nice but even slay the spire has better/smoother animations Also doesnt bug out as much and lose you cards/money/etc Ill have to check it out again after release to see if it fixed itself or is mostly aesthetic knockoff of a mobile-but-only-pc slay the spire;0.9;0.0;1.0;136.0;19 April, 2021;True;515
94;For The Warp; Way too short and its not just for the game being in Early Access I dont see much that could be put into this This game has great mechanics card creation kinda nice map movement although its not my favorite but what bothers me most is time you can play it Taking similar titles like Faster than light or Into the Breach they give you much more replay-ability Not taking into considaration Slay the Spire which Im not going to say this game is based on but is in similar style yet it makes you play over and over again  Overall Very nice game but price - play-time ratio is not worth it I really wish Im wrong here and devs have some ways like better campain in plan I would really look forward that;3.3;0.0;3.0;72.0;17 August, 2020;True;699
95;For The Warp; Unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this I like the premise having some elements of FTL but its extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile If they changed this I could see the game being a lot better but its restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity In my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies Its a refund for now but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care;0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;25 April, 2021;True;576
96;For The Warp; Managed to reach stage 4 and the game crashed When I reboot the game it resumed to the previous game where I failed;48.4;0.0;2.0;21.0;19 April, 2020;True;116
97;For The Warp;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Ultimately disappointing Listen to other popular negative comments Theyre right  This game struggles from extreme balancing issues I wouldnt even bother picking this up until theyre fixed if they ever are The drone carrier which seems like a super fun ship cant even get passed the first few battles in Hardcore because you cant keep your drones alive Basic issues like that stop this game from going up in the ranks of STS type games Art is super awesome at least  I also experienced an invincibility bug that made every enemy permanently miss me Got to see the whole game for free and unlocked everything  PS My time played is way off I think Im closer to around 10-12 hours;26.4;0.0;18.0;938.0;18 January, 2022;False;696
98;For The Warp; Disappointing Some builds of the game I couldnt even play because of technical issues aspect ratio/screen region problems couldnt detect inputs etc but beyond that the game design has very large flaws There is no disincentive for going to every single square and fighting every single enemy which makes the entire experience involve no meaningful decision making and having it be extremely tedious and boring There are large balance issues with certain cards being much too efficient and easy to consistently draw due to deck size Pass;2.9;0.0;1.0;85.0;29 June, 2021;True;536
101;For The Warp; The concept is great and it is fun for a little while but it gets old VERY fast  There is much better rogue lite deckbuilders out there for similar prices;0.4;0.0;21.0;499.0;24 October, 2021;True;155
102;For The Warp;Problems with the game so far 1 The basic ship balance is not there nothing comes even close to the secret ship 2 No upgrades to cards and no balance either 3 Too short for a release version 4 Bugs out should be in Beta;22.1;0.0;2.0;202.0;02 April, 2022;False;219
103;For The Warp; Fun little game for 4 hours Worth a play on offer  Completed it within that time though and after that there isnt much to make me want to play more  It doesnt have the re-playablity allure that FTL had for different runs / decks and unlocks;3.8;0.0;9.0;491.0;16 July, 2021;True;241
104;For The Warp;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW kinda fun but way to meany bugs on my first run for some reason my ship did not take any damage from attack leading to an easy not fun win on my 2nd run game would 3 times when leaving events/combat the game got sort of soft locked were i had to quit to main menu and continue run to to keep playing not game breaking but very annoying;11.1;0.0;0.0;67.0;05 February, 2022;False;355
105;For The Warp; Early Access review mostly entertaining but seems to make no attempt at balance A balance pass will presumably come before the launch from Early Access post-Early Access update nope no apparent attempts at balance If the Heart of the Cards smiles on you you will draw amazing combos for free or not need combos at all due to single-card win conditions Or occasionally you will roll up to an enemy who will immediately attack for more damage than your hull+shields combined while you draw no defense  This game has promise and will probably get better but as of November 2021 it is not a game I can recommend;5.9;0.0;0.0;1460.0;27 November, 2021;True;608
106;For The Warp;FTW doesnt have much of a story If any story It is lacking in ways to make the playable ships different All ships draw from the same card pool  The boss fights are just a big bag of health points Even the final fight is no different to all the fights that came before  With a name like FTW it is going to be compared to FTL And FTL is better in every way FTW could have learnt a LOT from them especially about story;18.6;0.0;12.0;465.0;06 April, 2022;False;415
107;For The Warp; its extremely broken and nearly unplayable graphics settings dont work no settings stay after closing the game it doesnt save or saves just before the end of a previous run but not the one i was just doing a lot of the cards just dont do anything text boxes and overlays and graphics either dont display or are stuck on the screen and stops any progression combined with the saving issue makes it an ironman run every time with the chance of finding a new card that does nothing and thatll clutter the small deck and kill you  Theres promise but Its very far from being worth the 15 bucks or the frustration of the experience it needs a lot of work before its ready;26.7;0.0;7.0;126.0;30 July, 2020;True;666
108;For The Warp; Like other reviews have said the draw mechanic is nonsensical You dont draw a card from the top you draw it from a pool So you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them  Finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire Got nothing for it Hardcore didnt even unlock Game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others Art is pretty nice the theme is good Ran into several bugs  Play Monster Train instead;1.7;0.0;30.0;490.0;05 August, 2020;True;484
109;For The Warp;Misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun Poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable There are also a lot of poor design decisions like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible Stack as much shield as possible every turn then spend remaining energy on attack cards with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing;7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;12 April, 2022;False;498
111;For The Warp;Product received for free  It really doesnt stand out at all Its just another one of those deck builder games It doesnt have much in the way of charm or originality;0.7;0.0;1.0;950.0;12 May, 2022;False;164

120;ELDEN RING;Elden Ring is one of those games you really get involved in you are fully mmersed in the story and the amazing world has so much to offer The game can be as hard as you want it to be but the difficulty scaling of this game is a side show compared to the lore that this game brings This game has revitalised the open world formula that we are so used to and i am so glad to have played this game as it is AMAZING 95/10 some repeat bosses map could be clearer at some regions but overall Game of the year 2022 Highly recommended to anyone who likes adventure games;138.1;1.0;0.0;39.0;22 May, 2022;False;562

141;ELDEN RING;Elden Rings open world is massive and gorgeous to behold There is no shortage of places to explore Its a welcome departure from its predecessors on-rails experience  The game is challenging and engaging It does not hold your hand so I recommend paying attention to dialogue environment and even item descriptions Some fights can feel punishing until you learn them well  There is a surprising amount of build depth and variety You can usually change out your weapon skills/spells or infusion to counter a difficult boss Watch the enemies carefully - they all have predictable telegraphs and attack patterns  There is no cross play with consoles so keep that in mind if you want to play with friends;219.3;1.0;0.0;111.0;16 May, 2022;False;698

950;Subnautica: Below Zero;definitely not as good as the first one half of the map is on land but the movement physics and creature mechanics there are lackluster and often annoying since half of the map is on land it means theres less content in sea they shouldve focused all of their efforts on the underwater part because the underwater biomes are not as good compared to the ones in first game and often look murky barren and boring despite all of this its still a subnautica game and you will get your fair share of clutch moments with local fauna the tapeworm infested crystal caves were actually pretty amusing;22.1;1.0;0.0;254.0;22 May, 2022;False;590

1114;Songs of Conquest;Product refunded  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Like someone who had never played the genre before tried to recreate Heroes and Might and Magic 3 based off a description Plays a lot like classic HOMM games with some modern conveniences but then just lacks in gameplay depth Hero upgrade trees are really boring and uninspired Just straightforward increases to numbers no new abilities or creative things to do the idea behind gating larger armies behind hero level is just stupid especially making you choose between army upgrades and size In the time I played I found no inspiration to keep playing and exploring the game as it just didnt seem that interesting  All it really made me want to do was reinstall HOMM 3 and relive the good old days;3.9;0.0;8.0;259.0;18 May, 2022;False;735
1116;Songs of Conquest;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Basically what most Turn-Based Strategy purists are saying on their negative reviews  The game is pretty quick it seems like the developers have focused more on creating a game that works for streams rather than a complex strategical game I dont think this issue will be addressed as its a core problem with the games foundation  Go play HoMM 3 or 5 and hope that Ubisoft sells the IP to a developer that cares;7.0;0.0;6.0;153.0;17 May, 2022;False;430
1117;Songs of Conquest;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Its not a bad game 7/10 I would say but Im a bit salty because  Hero level limit in the campaign missions is low and Ive picked learning bonus exp perk - seriously Why is there a learning perk in the campaign at all if you cant really take advantage of it Also - before you finish a mission you need to return all the artifacts to the main hero otherwise they are gone forever;11.0;0.0;7.0;414.0;22 May, 2022;False;396
1119;Songs of Conquest;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Gorgeous art marred by repetitive dull combat half-arsed uninteresting magic system and a world-map that trades meaningful exploration for a mobile-like clickathon as you meander from area to area aggressively clicking on whatever interesting sprites are in your way  I was lured in by the comparisons to HOMM but this has none of the depth Anyone making favourable comparisons or even stating this is better than HOMM 2/3 has obviously never played them Songs of Conquest is more like Kings Bounty albeit simplified;1.5;0.0;10.0;201.0;16 May, 2022;False;536

1123;Songs of Conquest;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Games concept is great however the AI is WAY overpowered when first starting the game and learning the ropes Need to have an easy setting for campaign No list of hotkeys- graphics could be sharpened so objects can be seen clearer Will be a great game when tweaked to balance the overpowered AI Wait for future updates unless you want to support developers which should be done Only voting no until game is not so difficult;13.7;0.0;6.0;112.0;17 May, 2022;False;442
1125;Songs of Conquest;EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game has a great foundation but $30 for a game that is at this stage extremely unbalanced has made me regret this purchase If you like turned based RPG style games you will play long enough to be disqualified for a refund and then discover the games difficulty jumps from 5 to 10 I did not actually play for 20 hours I fell asleep and left the computer on but I would have easily passed the 2 hour mark  So if youre a HARDCORE GAMER who wants to watch at all the YouTube tutorials just to figure out how to beat the first campaign on normal difficulty then this is the game for you;19.1;0.0;6.0;68.0;17 May, 2022;False;605
