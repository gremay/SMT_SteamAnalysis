EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game has a lot of potential. I like its style and base mechanics. But it's hard to really see the good parts in this game right now because of some fairly dire problems:

1. Balance. There doesn't seem to be any kind of ""base rate"" these cards are built on. Like, there's a card that increases shield capacity by 1 for 1 energy. Another card charges shields by 10 for 1 energy. Another card makes a 4/2 drone for 2 energy. There's also a card called ""AI Supremacy"" that gives you 10 shield capacity, 10 shield charges, and 4 4/4 drones. Going by the established rates, this card should cost at least 19 (ignoring the fact that it also gives you all these effects in one card). Instead it costs 3. Yes it's ""mythic""... but that should mean it's maybe twice as good, not 6 or 10 times as good. Having cards this strong makes your strategy and the enemy's strategy irrelevant - you just play your card and win. Things won't be perfectly balanced... but I feel like there could be a better attempt here.

2. Easy Exploits. Like Slay the Spire, it feels like health is a resource that should slowly exhaust through a stage, and most game mechanics here seem to suggest this was the plan. But there's a card that heals you and doesn't ""deactivate"". This means it's easy to kill all but one enemy, shield up, and loop through your deck until you're healed to full. I think there's one for credits too. You shouldn't be able to get these kinds of effects so easily (ie. with a single card and some patience). Learn the lessons of the other games in this space. These cards should exhaust.

3. Do-nothing events. Whatever is in the mysterious crate, don't have it be nothing. Again, I get this is early access... but I've played the game twice, and it feels like I've opened 6 empty crates. Events don't need fancy graphics or something - just placeholder in _something_.

Anyway, if I was you, dear reader, and if I was looking for a game to play now - I'd add this game to my wishlist, and come back to it once it has had a little more time to bake. But you shouldn't forget it, because I think it could be good.";4.6;1.0;252.0;493.0;Posted: 28 March, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have stated, FTL meets slay the spire.

HUGE potential here. I think a few things need reworked.

1. Balance: jmzero's review goes in depth.

2. No discard pile: this i feel is an odd design choice, since there's no discard pile, all cards used immediately go back to the deck, so attaining any new card is a constant lower percentile of getting any card in your deck on every turn. So you may never see your new card in play...ever. Since the deck is *shuffled* every turn. This is poor design, you cant structure synergy here, as you are constantly threatened to draw the same cards over and over. This just feeds into the balance problem, of ""just grab the most OP cards and scrap the rest""

3. Easy exploits: Again jmzero, nailed most of it. I will add shields (especially after unlocking a particular ship) are VERY exploitable. You can turtle up, create drones forever, and heal any dmg that gets by.

4. All events: now jmzero went over the crates. however, many ? events are lackluster. you find a trader...repair your ship...get fuel...sell fuel...etc. the only promising one is the temple ruins, but even that is just a choice of getting more credits at expense of fuel and hp, 5 times. Also to add to the crate, it doesn't help that the literal ""do-nothing"" iteration of that event can soft-lock the game!! (had it happen twice where the pop up doesn't go away ever, the event never ends, and i have to alt F4

4a. Slow-event handling: any pop-up, event, etc. is just slow to show up or finish.

even with these issues i can recommend this considering the alpha state. Potential buyers, i would say if you like FTL and slay the spire and want to support the devs, go for it, otherwise, wishlist it and wait.";9.3;1.0;36.0;289.0;Posted: 27 July, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It has the feel of FTL, but plays similar to slay the spire. The biggest turnoff for me, and what ended up causing me to refund it, is that you don't draw from your deck. Every turn, you get 5 random cards out of the cards in your deck. you could get the same hand over and over; it does not cycle through all the cards. For example, In my 21 card deck, I had one copy of a card that boosts the attack of all your active drones and 3 cards that made drones. In one battle (and the battles are decently lengthy) I drew the drone boost card every turn, but never once did I draw a card that made a drone. It was very frustrating. In addition, energy is not saved between turns but shields are (there is a shield capacity), so you can have totally wasted turns where you draw mostly shields and your shields are already at max so the turn just gets wasted.

In short, I enjoyed FTL and slay the spire but found this to be more frustrating than fun.";0.5;0.0;78.0;1004.0;Posted: 8 April, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a tentative recommendation.
Like many others have said, the game is fun but some things just don't work as you'd expect.
It's less a deck-builder and more a card pool-builder - you have discard & draw mechanics, but cards don't play in any sort of deck order. You can draw the same card in every hand, and never see others even over many turns.
The ability to explore sectors is cool, but it's not very useful and can encourage you to time-waste. Having played this I can understand why FTL has an enemy fleet chasing you. It's quite possible to become self-sufficient (gaining fuel with every battle & self-repairing) and clean out an entire sector, but there's little value to doing so - you'll have loads of money without anything useful to spend it on and just see the same two groups of enemies over and over.";36.3;1.0;15.0;693.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Ultimately disappointing. Listen to other popular negative comments. They're right.

This game struggles from extreme balancing issues. I wouldn't even bother picking this up until they're fixed, if they ever are. The drone carrier, which seems like a super fun ship, can't even get passed the first few battles in Hardcore because you can't keep your drones alive. Basic issues like that stop this game from going up in the ranks of STS type games. Art is super awesome at least.

I also experienced an invincibility bug that made every enemy permanently miss me. Got to see the whole game for free and unlocked everything.

P.S. My time played is way off. I think I'm closer to around 10-12 hours.";26.4;0.0;18.0;937.0;Posted: 18 January

IN A WORD: MAYBE
IN A NUTSHELL:
WHAT TO EXPECT:
Indie made. Space-faring roguelike. Futuristic sci-fi setting. Procedurally generated 2.5D star map. Turn-based strategic exploration. 2D side-on, turn-based card battler. Ship vs ship tactical combat. Session only deck-building. Requires constant deck management. RNG can cause heavy imbalance. Imbalance makes it very challenging. Quality pixel graphics & art. Matched by synth-pop soundtrack. Short on content. Some variety of components. Made to be replayable. Singleplayer only







For the Warp provided a mixed experience which has some surprisingly involved card-driven space combat. However, the hefty use of RNG gives it an unbalanced nature. One that is further complicated by a lack of mechanisms to limit its impact. Some gamers may find its content on the low side, but it has been made to be replayed. Very likely the reason for its steep difficulty curve.















For the Warp is a well made but unbalanced game. Strategic gameplay is good but could do with a few more additions and added variation. Tactical combat is at times an enjoyable experience with several viable strategies and synergies available. However, the substance deck-building possesses is affected by a level of RNG that causes its overall difficulty to rise steeply, detrimentally impacting balance.

This results in a frustrating experience which is why its rating falls from being worthwhile to a purchase, though only just.";17.5;1.0;20.0;923.0;Posted: 10 April

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As others have pointed out, this game has a lot of great features and has some compelling gameplay. However, there are three things that kill it for me because they lead too far down the path of heavy RNG.

1) The shuffler makes no sense. The fact that you don't discard cards and that every time you draw a hand that you are pulling from your entire deck is against the foundation of what a deck builder game is supposed to be. It has all of the other facets of how to build and manipulate your deck but the player should be drawing from a shuffled stack and continue to do such until the discard pile needs to be shuffled back in. I might have been less opposed to this if you could freely discard cards from your deck without needing to pay for it or have NPC's want to buy them during events. But as it stands, it is far to easy to get a 18-20 card deck and that is far too much RNG when doing pool draws.

2) Draft mode is not worth playing due to the design of ships and certain cards. Each ship has a core deck archetype that goes with them. To top it off, you are shown 10 cards to pick from, then 9, then 8, etc. While this would certainly be what you would experience playing Magic: the Gathering, the cards do not have enough synergy to interface with each other in this format let alone to build a half way viable starter deck that matches the ship you selected. Also, you select the ship BEFORE you draft which should be the other way around. See what comes to you and what archetype you can build towards then decide what ship you want. The problem stated in #1 compounds this since you might not have that many shield cards and drawing them when you are getting blasted for 40 damage a round in the first map is not a good experience.

3) While playing in normal mode, there are certain cards you need to make your ship's archetype deck come together and there is no way to guarantee that you get those. As such, it leads to runs that are destined to fail because you, through RNG, just don't power up your deck to the point that you can handle later encounters. Especially when you get screwed by not drawing what you need from your pool (see #1) for several turns.


I like the premise of the game and it has a great foundation. Hopefully, these issues will get addressed by the developer in the near future as I look forward to playing this game after those patches land.";12.2;0.0;16.0;235.0;Posted: 10 January, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Like other reviews have said, the draw mechanic is nonsensical. You don't draw a card from the top, you draw it from a pool. So you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them.

Finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire. Got nothing for it, Hardcore didn't even unlock. Game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others. Art is pretty nice, the theme is good. Ran into several bugs.

I like the look, the theme and general direction this game is taking. Pixel art spaceships and roguelike.....take my credits! But For the Warp (FtW) makes you appreciate FTL, Slay the spire (StS) and many other roguelikes;

I am not enjoying the gameplay right now. It feels very RNG heavy and I'm constantly getting my butt kicked. The first ship is not very good with it's measly shield cap of 10hp and you will routinely run into groups of 3 enemies who hit for 9dmg each a round. Bosses hit for 10-20, and mid sized enemies can also do 10-20 damage. It's very hard to keep your shields up while also putting up an offense. The second ship is immediately better boasting 15shield cap and a ton of attack and draw cards. The game drastically gets more fun in the second ship, but the world is still wonky and not set up in an approachable way. I hope the other ships are cooler still but I don't feel inspired to play more and unlock them.

The grid you fly around on is frustrating. I find I""m getting bombarded with enemies, then bombarded with allied ships but there isn't any way for me to know ahead of time what I will run into. In FTL you could see the whole region and make a guess at which routes to avoid and which ones would be better. In FtW you only know one space ahead and backtracking costs precious fuel. You will run out resources.

In SlayTheSpire you could also plan ahead how many bosses/rests/merchants you'd roughly encounter. In FtW you can't plan at all. I""m often sitting outside the boss gate with 10%hp and not enough fuel to explore for help. Was I supposed to power through in a straight line? How many encounters should I risk for loot? It's incomprehensible.

I miss that in FTL the stations all offered the same services. You could always buy fuel, repair and purchase from a wide variety of weapons, drones and ship upgrades. SlayTheSpire had a similarly good merchant who offered card removal and card upgrades along with his RNG items. FtW could really benefit from stable merchants. The cost of fuel and repair is wildly different and making that last fuel jump to a station that doesn't sell fuel is very frustrating. I could see space games drop fuel as a mechanic if I""m honest.

The merchants in FtW would be better if they had actual selection. Three cards and one equipment is silly small. There are many deck styles you could build in this game. Either make the cards cheaper so that you can buy a large number and design your play deck and side deck, or give the players way more selection. In one instance I had a significant amount of money, and I bought more equipment than I could use, but there is nothing you can do with it afterwards. No merchant buys equipment from you and it's not relevant to any story based encounters. So if you don't plan on using the cards, you can't reliably get rid of them and they don't serve a story purpose....can I send the out the airlock?

Ultimately I want this game to be good but I don't like it right now. I am leaving a down vote so that the Devs see this feedback, but I also hope that other players will play the game in hopes that the devs get the resources they need to continue. I won't be refunding and will keep my fingers crossed that some of my concerns are addressed, or that other improvements are made.";2.1;0.0;18.0;219.0;Posted: 29 March

FTW doesnt have much of a story. If any story.
It is lacking in ways to make the playable ships different. All ships draw from the same card pool.

The boss fights are just a big bag of health points.
Even the final fight is no different to all the fights that came before.

With a name like FTW, it is going to be compared to FTL. And FTL is better in every way. FTW could have learnt a LOT from them, especially about story.";18.6;0.0;12.0;462.0;Posted: 6 April

Can't immediately quit and restart a new run easily. Instead forced to sit through laggy menus and scenes everytime. I'm going to re-roll those initial selections A LOT, so I'd rather not waste my time. Everything else is slow too, with no speed-up option. Why does everything take so long? Why can't I click past events?

You only get 3 (maybe 5) trinkets max, so there's no going crazy with those. Most cards seem weak, except for some really busted ones. Deck is reshuffled every turn with no discard pile(??). Better to cull your deck than build one and wait for one of the busted cards. Prices at the shops seem all over the place. Value in general seems could use some reconsidering.

Also buggy with events just not working sometimes, forcing restarts.

Some weird choices that make it more frustrating than fun.";21.5;0.0;9.0;284.0;Posted: February 22

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This game is far too barebones currently. There is no real meaningfull synergy. The best way to beat the game is to simply remove cards from your starting deck so that you can fill it with cards that cost 0 and draws 1. It has cards that are too strong like reversing all enemy intents for 0 energy. It becomes more of a war of how much time do you wish to spend on the save rather than how great of play do you do and how interesting of a deck you can build and due to that there are never any exciting moments where you live on a sliver of health. You can tell from the first three battles if this run will be worth doing or not. Its not totally meaningless but it would need quite the rehaul to make it worth playing more than once, let alone pay for it";7.1;0.0;8.0;122.0;Posted: February 7, 2021

Misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun. Poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable. There are also a lot of poor design decisions, like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible: Stack as much shield as possible every turn, then spend remaining energy on attack cards, with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing.";7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;Posted: April 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I don't think I can recommend For the Warp in its current state (January 2021). After three hours, I already beat the game once after 4-5 tries and I don't have that urge to try and beat the game with the other ships like I do in other roguelites.

Encounters are fairly repetitive with low variance and there doesn't seem to be much variety in enemy types. All enemies seem to do mostly the same thing just with varying HP pools. It's not even close to Slay the Spire where different encounters require you to approach the enemies differently.

Card balance seems a little off. A number of cards seem to require you to get other cards to make them useful, but there's no guarantee you're ever even going to see cards of those types. On the other hand, I have been able to make some broken combos using cards that aren't crap on their own.

There's also poor explanation of mechanics. For example, one card I've seen has the Explosive property. It sounds like it's supposed to ignore X% of armor, but it just says 0% on there. Is there something I'm missing? I also still don't understand how the Synergy keyword works with its vague description. Another card tells me it does more damage for each ""Plasma"" type in my hand, but I don't know how to tell if a card is Plasma type or not. I thought maybe it was if the card had ""Plasma"" in the name, but my starter cards with Plasma in the name didn't seem to count.

On a positive note, the game looks and sounds pretty good, although I do wish cards had more on-screen effects. The game also has a twist on deck building where there is no discard, which I find interesting. Cards you play in a turn immediately get sent back and shuffled into the deck. This causes you to approach deck building a little different than the typical deck building approach where you don't reshuffle until you've played your entire deck.

Right now, I think they need to work on card balance and make encounters actually interesting. With every encounter playing out the same, the game gets boring extremely fast.";2.9;0.0;8.0;2340.0;Posted: January 21, 2021

I've played a lot of FTL and Slay the Spire as well as many other deckbuilding/exploration/roguelikes. They are my favorite games, and so I was sad that this one missed the mark for me. It looked right up my alley, but the problem was that there was just too much RNG in the way without a lot of time to counter it. I couldn't find the mechanic to scrap cards fast enough so my deck became bloated fast, and I kept running into unavoidable unwinnable fights. I investigated one space and fought some mega-ship that did 30-50 damage a shot. I had the card to escape a combat but I was dead before I drew it.

And why is my starting hand only 3 cards? When there are three ships each swinging for 9 damage on the first round and I draw 3 base attacks it's not much help. Also, 3-9 is not an acceptable range of damage for me to plan around, nor is 10-18. That's too much control for the RNG to have and I'm not interested in continuing to play until the RNG gods deem it appropriate for me to win.

I do like that your shields carry over if you don't use them, but that just means I over-shield every time and only attack when I'm above the max shield. shrink the ranges, or maybe do away with them altogether, but at least shrink them.

I'm more than willing to keep trying and to figure it out, but then there is the issue that the core mechanics were not very fun. I don't see why I need to select my ship in order to shield if I'm the only ship that's there that logically I would want to shield. Explain to me why I have to select a ship to attack if there is only one target. It would be more fun if there was a right-click default action for cards that are obvious on how a general player would use them.

Also, the cutscenes and dialog aren't fast enough for me. Put the text up there, allow me to hit enter to skip it. Every single time you approach something t h e g a m e h a s t o m a k e y o u w a i t t o r e a d t h e d e s c r i p t i o n and it bores me every time. I read fast and I don't play games to be bored. Maybe there's a setting to control this in the options, fine, but whatever the fastest setting in should be the default and there should be a setting to slow it down if you like long-drawn out time to read text because I'm going to go ahead and assume that's the minority.

It's very possible this game could hook people but for me there are too many games out there without these issues, so I can't recommend trying this out.

For the Warp is like many Roguelike Deck builders, but not the addictive properties of games like, Slay the Spire.
By no means, is FtW a bad game. In this Early Access, the game is solid. I think I've only experienced one bug, and could not replicate it (My ship that just disappeared, and could not move).
Cards and interactions with enemies are what you expect. They're balanced. I think I've cleared three runs out of my ten.
Onto their Draft.
One of the best things, is it's auto unlocked. For those of us who love sealed and drafts, Devs, great job.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a large card pool. While each ship starts off with a different deck of cards. Each ship can branch out and do something the others can. With such a small card pool, decks do feel rather similar. I hope as time goes on, more cards are added.

If you get the right (aka broken) combinations of cards/upgrades at the beginning: easy win.
Or you don't, then it's almost a guaranteed loss.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
In it's current form - avoid.

The card design is extremely simple, the diversity between 'ships' limited, the difficulty is extremely low and, perhaps worst of all, it's so utterly slow.

Both because of animation speeds, enemy health/shield pools, and the limited damage output of even your most synergy-dependant, powerful attacks, battles take a very long time by ""roguelite deckbuilder"" standards (though perhaps you may be used to the pace if you've played a lot of Deck of Ashes). But a big issue is that each map - of the 5 you go through for one 'run' of the game - is filled to the brim with enemy encounters and there's very rarely anything stopping you from going through all of them, plus the myriad of beneficial random encounters and 'quest'-like events dragging you back and forth over the map very, very slowly.

I suspect the ""Fuel"" mechanic - as well as your health limits - is intended to prevent you from just fighting constantly for huge quantities of money and other partial benefits, but it fails to function because there are cards that let you easily earn Fuel in-battle, as well as heal in-battle, as well as even permanently remove selected cards from your deck in-battle. As a result, you can easily just leave 1 enemy alive in a battle then spend all of the time you need healing to full, optimizing your deck and restocking your fuel (until the enemy eventually runs away).

In its current state, a very poor handling of in-battle resources with out-of-battle, run-long resources leaves a glacially paced, unfulfilling and fundamentally boring game, lacking inventive classes, deckbuilding, story or much of anything else. I do give some credence to the aesthetic and theming of the game, but even that runs dry quickly when there appears to be as little as 3 (4?) visually distinct enemies per map, and (not counting bosses) seemingly only about 18 or so types of enemies in the game.

And those 18 enemy types are painfully similar. In fact, same with bosses. Enemies just... attack you for X-Y damage, shield themselves (basically self-heal) for X-Y damage, and... that's actually almost it. Occasionally they will take an offensive action like decrease your max shield or place an absolutely trivial damage-over-time effect to you (like ""1 damage over 3 turns"" at a time when enemies are regularly doing 10-14 damage with regular attacks). Occasionally an enemy may spawn a new enemy which... just does the same thing. Deal X-Y damage, shield themselves for X-Y, or do some minor amount of DoT or max shield decrease.

On top of all of the many issues, even if they fixed the ability to exploit battles to maximize all of your resource gains too easily, your cards are both super slow and yet they easily let you break the game. In my first battle, I was just playing a ""barrel roll"" card every turn rendering me literally immune to damage on each turn, and there seemed to be no penalty or limitation to doing so.

Bad balance, minimal content, minimal variety, minimum difficulty, terrible pacing. This is, sadly, probably the worst deckbuilding roguelike game I've played on Steam.";2.9;0.0;4.0;378.0;Posted: August 15, 2020

The game is ok, but the total randomness of the cards really detracts. Starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships. If you encounter multiple 3 ship groups in a row you just plain lose. The damage output balance is very weak. It feels like a beta game. Drafting is cool, but way over powered compared to the base decks.";63.2;0.0;5.0;70.0;Posted: April 6

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I love the art style and design of the game. I have beaten the game on hardcore and draft with every ship. The game in its current state is very minimalistic. Each run through you need to eliminate most of the starter cards. Mass Driver is essential for every single deck, this card needs to have a chance to be permanently destroyed each time it is used. I can make perfect draw decks with Mass Driver. The game is very easy simply by getting a few heal cards and getting as many +to max shield cards. What the game lacks most is meaningful interactions with aliens. They need to hire some cartoonists or comic strip writers to make some satirical and fun interactions with aliens. The game is too easy, I can gauranteed win every single run through by farming a zone. This game needs to take a note from Slay the Spire and Hades by adding some scaling difficulty modifiers to keep players challenged and interested. I do recommend this game, but many updates need to come.";120.3;1.0;3.0;130.0;Posted: February 26, 2021

Way too short and it's not just for the game being in Early Access. I don't see much that could be put into this.
This game has great mechanics, card creation, kinda nice map movement although it's not my favorite, but what bothers me most is time you can play it. Taking similar titles like Faster than light or Into the Breach they give you much more ""replay-ability""
Not taking into considaration Slay the Spire which I'm not going to say this game is based on, but is in similar style yet it makes you play over and over again.

Overall Very nice game but price - play-time ratio is not worth it. I really wish I'm wrong here and devs have some ways like better campain in plan. I would really look forward that";3.3;0.0;3.0;72.0;Posted: August 17, 2020

For the warp is awesome!

the team has a lot of future additions planned but even as it is, it's a solid game, every playthrough is different and interesting.

the artwork is awesome, i'm a sucker for pixel graphics and this game sports some of the best.

i'm 60 hours in and i'm sure i'll still feel as enthusiastic about this game in another 60 hours.

if you love turn based games
if you love pixel art
if you love space

buy this.
it's worth every cent. and we need to throw as much money as we can to the devs Massive Galaxy so that they can continue to make games as awesome as this one.

This still feels like it's in early access, and could use some work before it's set. At the moment, the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions. Most of the cards you get also just don't see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - they're just small numbers boosts a lot of the time.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
An engaging and well executed sci-fi roguelike deckbuilding card game, where you play as a sort of rogue trader that sees his route cut off when returning with a large shipment of goods (last big score kind of situation). As a result, you have no option but to try to survive by traversing though the galaxy's most dangerous paths.

This game has, simply put, amazing pixel art and music. The mood is perfect for its genre and you will, for certain, sometimes stop just to appreciate it visually.

In terms of gameplay, the card mechanics play as a space battle, based on 4 elements - attack, shield, status effects and deck manipulation. So far I'm really liking the type of synergies you can create between cards and the amount of variation already existing. As for your ship, in this version, you start the game by selecting from only two types of ships, with different characteristics, but more are planned.

To be clear, you can tell that it's an Early Access game from the amount of existing content and a few balancing issues it still has. However, the developer is clearly listening to players and using feedback to improve overall balance (I got the game on itch.io, where he did a soft-launch, to get feedback as soon as possible, for that exact purpose). Furthermore, his roadmap already includes more content and his updates have been quite frequent, always adding new stuff and fixing issues as they arise.

Overall, I'd say the game is very promising and already quite fun. A definite recommend!";9.0;1.0;3.0;206.0;Posted: March 27, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Not too shabby, for being early access.

Picture a space-fairing version of Slay the Spire, but without as much content or variation. Since this is the absolutely bare-bones first release of this game in EA, I'll say that there's enough here to make me look forward to the progress the devs make and the certainly, the final product.

Standard card-adventure fare. Start with 3 energy, use a combo of block, attack and status cards, blow up ships and move around a map in search of treasure or death. Nice art style, nice music.

I think this should be 10 bucks. 15 bucks for the full product would be fine, but this is EA and, while fun, the game is still limited in scope.

If you like supporting devs and like card-based games, it's worth your time. If you're in zero rush for something new to check out, you might want to see how often it gets updated before you toss down your money.";35.7;1.0;4.0;964.0;Posted: March 27, 2020

I enjoyed this game quite a bit, enough to play for 30 hours, but I really wish there was more meta progression (and more content!) Ships and difficulty modes are the only unlocks, and I feel it would be much more engaging/addictive if there was something more to unlock, such as different cards or bonuses. The atmosphere is good, and I enjoyed the music and art style for what it is. I did think the giant ""FTW!"" after every battle was kind of childish and annoying, but I got used to it eventually. I'd like to see some different enemies, as on some maps I felt like I was just fighting the same three enemies on every battle (yawn.) The RNG didn't bother me as much as some other people, I felt it added a layer of strategy and use for the hand-manipulating cards. I also liked that you could save mid-run. All in all, if you enjoy roguelike deckbuilders and a space setting, you'll probably have fun with this one for a little while.";32.1;1.0;1.0;522.0;Posted: April 9

I've been having a lot of fun with FTW. There's definite stylistic comparisons that can be drawn between FTW and FTL with influence from Slay the Spire, but it's a standalone game. Given that it's a Rogue-like-like it can have some randomness problems, but is overall pretty well balanced. There isn't much of a story at this time, but as of this writing (alpha 0.6.1) it's very early in it's development.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For an early alpha build, this game shows a tremendous amount of potential! I truly don't understand the recent knee-jerk reviews causing this to have a 'Mixed' rating, because as a huge fan of both StS and FTL I can assure potential players that this game is on the right track. Probably the same whiny crowd that complains about ""too much RNG"" (it's not, you just suck.)

WHAT IT GETS RIGHT:
1. The feel of both Slay the Spire & FTL at the same time.
2. Pick up and Play feel, no annoyingly long tutorial
3. Great art & sound (even if fairly repetitive, which can be forgiven at this stage of development.)
4. Variety of playable cards already

WHAT NEEDS WORK (IMO):
1. More variety of music (same battle music almost if not every combat)
2. Better indication of status effects (difficult to tell what has debuffed you, what the enemy has done, etc.)
3. Greater selection of cards and actions; as it stands the game is fun but a little repetitive.
4. Greater variety of chance encounters
5. Better animation/draggable cards. I've accidentally used cards I'd not intended because of this.

The above are minor complaints if at all, as I quite like the game and have a lot of faith in the future of it. It could indeed surpass my love for StS if executed properly. As far as recent purchases go, I'm very pleased with this one. If you like StS and/or FTL in any capacity, give this a try.";6.1;1.0;5.0;444.0;Posted: August 19, 2020

This one is tough for me and may come across as a negative review, but it really isn't. I absolutely adore the overall idea of this game. A spaceship version of Slay the Spire? Hell yes! However, it often feels like it's deliberately holding the player back from having too much fun.

The game ends a zone or two too soon, right when your build is the most fun to play. The Hardcore mode levels up as you play Normal and Draft, but there's no way to level it back down again. It's stuck at Level 10 for me which makes the first zone nearly impossible out the gate. Speaking of Draft mode, it's my favorite, but some ships are just plain better for it than others, which is sad. I wish each ship had more tangible differences than just the amount of hull/shields it starts with. It's also difficult to build an efficient deck without predictable scrapping opportunities. The shop card offerings are very limited and there's no way to sell back excess equipment. I'm often swimming in credits and loaded down in stuff I don't want but can't get rid off. Definitely detracts from the overall fun of the experience.

Is it worth the price? Sure, but I was really hoping for more longevity from it. I'm giving it a recommend because I've had a good deal of fun with it, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Also, the game would be PERFECT for Steam Workshop. I can already imagine the awesome mods the community could create.";36.0;1.0;1.0;330.0;Posted: May 13

I don't quite want to give this game a bad review but it desperately needs some balancing, more events, and more varied fights. Seems like a very early release for something that still seems like a beta

Missing UI and information
- Does a drone get hit when you take damage? Is it random? How does drone HP work?
- What's my max HP? If you have cards that act on a ship having 50% HP, I need some indicator of what max health is
- This card generates X card. What is that card?
- Directional moving can be a little hard to parse sometimes

Sometimes the game just...doesn't seem to process correctly. I use all my energy...and still need to click end turn. I purchase a service from an NPC ship...and the screen doesn't progress. I exit to menu and there's no option to continue my in progress game...but I close the game and reopen it and now it shows.

This game has great art and music. It has some great idea. Execution though...this game is still early access. I've had fairly regular bugs. Needs balancing, like there are OP cards that discard your hand but cost all your energy so there's no real downside.

I'd like to come back to this game in a few months but I can't recommend it as is. Hope the dev can make some improvements.";2.0;0.0;2.0;431.0;Posted: March 31

Very impressive early access game. A very good challenge with some new twists from the average deckbuilder (there's no discard pile for one, which means every card in your deck has an equal chance of being selected each turn). This might mean your big card is in your hand every turn or you never see it throughout a combat, or anywhere in between. The only minor issues I've seen are slightly overpowered bosses early in the game and a risk-reward movement system that doesn't quite do what it's intended to do, but the developer is on the message boards and talks to his players so hopefully some of these things will get ironed out over time. Honestly, one of the best early access games I've ever played on Steam and I have every reason to believe it will only get better with time.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For The Warp has a lot of charm.
The bit-style art is nice, the music is fun and appropriate.
But the game is severely lacking in the balance department.
This lack of balance really makes you relinquish any feeling of real freedom that your choices matter; as you can make every ""perfect"" play and you'll still lose pretty quickly.
The difficulty stacked up against you cannot be overstated, and the constant over-powered opponents are a wall too high to climb with skill, as you'll often feel like the encounters you win are due to pure luck.

Attacks have no ""chance"" to hit either-- just a range of damage it WILL do.
You can never actively evade or dodge. You can never attempt to escape an opponent who is too overwhelming for you.
So you're stuck just watching your whole run get blown away due to a random (and seemingly likely chance) you'll see an opponent who just mops the floor with you.

To add to the difficulty, you start the game with 100 coins and can buy from a selection of 3-4 random cards.
That's it.
You are stuck using your incredibly under-powered deck of actions against opponents which can out-damage you, out-shield you, and have the benefit of numbers on you almost every combat.

You most certainly will run out of fuel EVERY game, as the only way to stay alive, being so severely outgunned all the time, is to try and avoid conflict (and you can't).
You don't make enough money to do anything important, nor will you run across a way to fix your ship's shields.
Running out of fuel will invite even more overpowered encounters to spawn directly on you-- to where you will eventually throw your hands up and put the game back on the shelf.

I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's too unbalanced and you won't want to play very long when you feel like the game constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ you without any determinable merit to the challenge.";0.9;0.0;4.0;353.0;Posted: March 21, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
FOR THE WARP definitely a game i will be playing for a long time. Its a deck builder where you start out with a bunch of cards which during the course of your journey you can trade or sell for resources such as fuel, new weapons and ship upgrades etc. Card selection is vast and it all makes sense with the science fiction theme and how they play out. Combat is fun where you can win if you play your cards right :) even when it seems the odds against you. Keeping your shields fully charged is very important to prevent physical ship damage. You will meet others in your travels who can provide repairs for something in return or give you fuel when your running low. I think one time someone even did this for free.

When defeating a boss you will unlock a new ship with new gear adding the variety of things that can be done. Maps are areas of space you can cross any way you want while trying to avoid too many hostile encounters as you attempt to get to the warp exit location. The maps are full of random encounters such as distress calls and ruined civilizations where something foreboding happened in the past. You will also come across merchant zones where you can purchase new cards.

Music is good though at the moment i believe there are only like two or three songs. One for exploration and another for combat. Since its early access many are hoping more music will be added.

Sorry but here isn't middle score just good or bad.
I will change this negative flag if the developer fixing some issue.

Good/OK:
The main concept.
Pixel art.

Less Good:
- Sound average (as comrade Dyatlov would say: ""not good not bad"")
- Music very repetitive but not a big concern (some mp3 in the background can fix it)
- Events variation too few and very ""dry"" - some real surprise or humor it would be shake up the game
- Few ship (3) :yes - I think the dev plan more
- Few combination for upgrade - I know more balance issue

Bad (why am I wrote the review):
- Third Ship the KD Carrier. This ship starter card kit is a joke.
I played through 3 system (kill all enemies on every map) with the second ship (Light Destroyer) and lose with the bad karma - constant bad card and all the Enemy ships hit with max damage...
But the Carrier has only low shield and weak Drone cards at the beginning (most spawn - yes I can select some others at the beginning but they are rare in the first couple of battle) and if I meet the first triad Ship group they instant eat up my Hull - maybe not kill just make it difficult to continue .

This game is extremely fun, even for me, someone who is new to this genre. The cards in this game are pretty broken, so it's really fun just to destroy your enemies. Most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive. My only issue is the last ship's deck being drones and shields. While I understand it's suppose to be a defensive play style, it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks, even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card. I would probably buff the shield cards, but it's not a big deal. Overall, a fun game with crucial decision making, wits, and rng.";15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;Posted: April 22, 2020

Terrible game, dont buy it.
It seems like a mix of Slay the Spire and FTL, but with only the worst parts of both games.
- Tedious and boring fights, you are limited to about 2 types of encounters per region which repeats for about 5 to 10 times per region. On top of that, All enemies are essentially the same with different stats, as they largely have the same attack moves.
- Pointsless events, the best part of FTl and Slay the Spire was to step on those question mark tiles and not knowing what to expect. In this game 9 out of 10 times is you get some fuel/ cash or sell/scrap a card for cash.
- Ships that you unlock are the same just with different starting stats and starting deck. Making progression meaning less.
- The equipments that you can find are about as basic as it gets.";7.4;0.0;5.0;92.0;Posted: March 30

You can definitely tell that this is still in early access based on the balance, card variety, and viable strategies. That said, I've had a blast so far and am looking forward to see what gets added, adjusted, and built up in the future.

Follow-on edit: After another 5 hours or so and a few updates to the game, I can definitely say For the Warp is worth picking up. There are definitely things that need to get fleshed out and improved (I'm still not sure how to make the drone-based ship work for me), but it is clear that they're moving in a positive direction.

Edit #3: A few more updates have improved the balance I think, at least while going through the systems. There is still a bit of an issue around whether you can lose a good chunk of health on the first turn if you get a bad draw/enemy intentions. Then again, bad luck is an element of this sort of game so I can't really fault them too much for it. The only place where it really becomes a problem is bosses as a couple of the later ones can take nearly 50% of your HP.";25.1;1.0;1.0;267.0;Posted: April 7, 2020

If you like one of these, you will also like this. The pixel art is nice, the hard combos are fun, and the gameplay is very fluid with clear UI and nice feedback. The game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature. Sometimes the runs are hard, sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo, both are rewarding.
Right now, the content is still less than FTL and StS, but both these game are unusual for the replayability.
I easily played 10h more than shown here one Steam, and still will play more.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this. I like the premise, having some elements of FTL but it's extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one, drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile. If they changed this I could see the game being a lot better, but it's restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity. In my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies. It's a refund for now, but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care.";0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;Posted: April 25, 2021

游戏中的资源：钱 油 hp 都有对应的卡可以在战斗中赚到
有些卡的入手时间直接影响你能不能活下去 比如mass driver每场战斗可以让你踢掉一张不在你手牌里的卡 对一些卡组来说越早削薄卡组越早开始血赚

敌人会在大概13回合以后逃跑 暂时不知道逃跑会不会影响掉落质量
比较难受的是一部分增益状态不会显示 比如barrel roll 2费下回合不受直接伤害
然后一回合打出的牌数也是有限制的 没仔细数过 可能在20张左右 也是没有任何显示就说你船过热了不让你出牌
每次过完图会在新地图原地生成一个商店 而只有这个商店的卡牌和装备是无限补充的 所有商店只能访问一次 而地图里的商店提供的服务和货物数目都是有限的 为了赌商店去跑路战斗觉得很不值
装备只有买来堆积 目前没有把不需要的装备换成资源的办法
最亏的是遗迹 亏血亏油 很大概率收获一张商店里能刷到的垃圾

Super Short Review:
This game is an absolute gem and well worth picking up if you enjoy deck-building and space-themed strategy.

Slightly Longer Review:
If you enjoy Slay The Spire or similar deck-building games and you have played space-themed titles like Eve Online and Elite Dangerous... oh boy, will you enjoy this game.

It's a super well polished approach to the genre, featuring beautiful pixel art, a catchy soundtrack and great game design. The hints of lore in this Alpha version already have me intrigued about all the ""races"" and very distinguishable ship designs, the ""oomph"" of card synergy power is very well executed, the feeling of challenge and the achievement when you beat each of the bosses is on point and it even had me gasping at certain random encounters (that I won't spoil) I did not expect, but have left me further intrigued.

I have only managed to collect a single ""legendary"" grade card so far but it already had me working to build a deck around it and I could not put the game down until I managed to unlock all the ships available so far and take them for a spin.

Overall, I am very eager to continue playing and for all the ways I can see this game growing towards its 1.0 release. I can estimate that the content in this current build will probably have me playing it for around 10 hours, but I will definitely follow its development for the chance to play more For The Warp.

A great game that will only get exponentially better as it gets more content.";8.1;1.0;2.0;170.0;Posted: April 9, 2020

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I can't in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could. As other reviews have said, this game has potential. I truly believe this game as good potential, the stuff to become a great game. But, it has an issue. A major glaring issue.

It has no replayability. For a game priced at $21.5 AUD, I would expect there to be some replayability in this game. Now granted, it has done something to that end. There are 5 ships in the game. The problem with those ships however is that they only affect starting cards and stats. Nothing about the run itself changes. Card rewards are the same. Encounters are basically dealt with in the same manner. No special equipment for individual ships. Nothing. Once you start a game, it's all the same.

I can't see myself playing this game again. I am bored. I am bored of this game. I know how I should play now, I know what makes for a good deck of cards and what isn't. I know what all of the encounters are like now. Although on that topic, what's the point in different encounters? The different encounters barely affect by I play. Some encounters will be more health draining then others based on some RNG factors, while others I just pass through not even so much as a scratch. Difficulty isn't what makes encounters different, but the encounters are so similar and samey, that's how I see them. My play-style doesn't change, just how much health I am going to lose.

With the ships not changing how the game itself is run, and the encounters all blurring together. The first couple of runs will be fun, but after that. It's all the same. I can not recommend this game if you value replayability.";5.8;0.0;1.0;112.0;Posted: November 25, 2021

Read, i explain it all.

=> The game DON'T AUTOSAVE ! (or it's totaly bugged)

I was doing a run, was at the end, was going to lose next turn on a boss because RNG hate you, you know'

So i Alt-F4, expecting a save at the start of the battle or just before, how foolish i was. First of all, all my run progress got erased, like i never did it (so bye bye the unlock of ships, still got the success thought, but useless) and worst of all, when i clicked continue, it loaded a save of my previous run !

Another thing very infuriating is the first round of battles, you ONLY draw 3 cards (knowing your hand is limited to five), so basicaly, you got enemies who are mostly going to hit you first round, and a good amount of time, you are just defenseless because jesus, you only have 3 CARDS, did you realize how much it's horrible more you advance in the chapters ? Taking free damages for this reason only is stupid, just let us got a basical 5 cards starting hand for god sake.

Also, ION attacks aren't considered attacks for counter maneuvering, nor even ofensives non-direct attacks actions.

Other problem, there isn't enough explanations on your cards (when your mouse is on it), you mostly are like ""wtf this is doing"" and there is no glossary to explain in game.

Another obscure thing who is, there is no discarded deck, so all discarded cards return to your deck, this mean you can draw a tons of cards before having the ones you need because of RNG, this isn't logic. Plus, there is so little numbers of stations or other who can scrap cards, worst of it is the stations who does it, does it only one time, and the best (very rare) stations who do it repeatidly do it for a huge cost.

Talking about stations, there is a true problem for the fuel, you can't really take the time to explore, but you can't really go in one line because not every station sell fuel, it's mostly rare or costly.

Right now, don't take too much cards in your deck even if you can have a ton, because of the 3 cards starting hand and the fact there is (it seems) no discard deck, and scraping cards is too rare or too costly. The problem ? It seems you can endlessly got the sames cards before pulling the ones you desperately need.

And i just played in normal.

There is good ideas in this game, but the cumulative littles problems everywhere ruin them.";12.2;0.0;3.0;274.0;Posted: April 1

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There are some interesting concepts here but some weird decisions that, ultimately, I didn't enjoy.

* It's bizarre to me that you start with 3 cards instead of a full deck... No idea why that decision was made (but I'm assuming there is one...?) This means you'll easily take 9-27 damage (probably more later on) without being able to charge your shields or prevent damage (unless you get lucky with your draw on those first three cards) That's my biggest complaint, really. I flew through the first system no problem but died within two encounters on the second system due to this mechanic.

* I enjoyed the sci-fi spaceship/deckbuilding setting and the art is pretty good. Seeing the animations for the corresponding card you played is pretty cool. The backgrounds are bright and colorful and it's always fun to look at. The music was pretty great but seemed to be a bit repetitive?

* 'Burn' (think 'bleed' in other games - damage over time) doesn't take effect until the end of the enemy turn... which is a strange decision as well in my opinion. It doesn't allow the damage to be a real 'game-changer'. You'll take the enemy's attacks and THEN they die... which really hurts your momentum on a run since your HP carries over.

To be fair, I only played this for about 0.4 hours before dying and deciding I didn't enjoy it. It's possible that the game continues to open up as you progress (as deck-building games usually do) I want to like this game and will definitely keep an eye on it as it continues to progress through early access. If you like this genre of game you might really vibe with it... I'm sure I'll pick it up again in the future but I don't think it's something I want to play just yet.";0.4;0.0;0.0;507.0;Posted: September 14, 2021

Played the hell out of the demo, enjoyed it
Bought the game when it was released in Early Access
Found the card Mass Driver, which let me thin my deck down to 2 cards - Barrel Roll and Last Resort
Wiped out the last two sectors without taking any damage at all
The last boss set me on fire once, and made me draw one fewer card once, which allowed him to hit me for 7 hp

Overall, the game is enjoyable, but completely unbalanced - long way to go before final release

I'm gonna try the hardcore mode, but i don't expect much out of it - it'll probably have tougher enemies, so it'll be more difficult for me to assemble a dominating build, but the fundamental flaw of plain vanilla game mechanics isn't going anywhere

Also, all the enemies are the same, just different skins and stats, nothing interesting - seen one, seen 'em all

2 things before we begin
1st even though this is a negative review i still enjoy the game, and will probably change this review after a few patches
2nd This is the edited version.

This game is far to RNG heavy, and i think it could be fixed with 1 of 2 things.
Either give us the power to build a deck, by removing or adding cards to your deck, even if it is just at the start of the sector.
Or give us a bigger choice of cards at the start of each Sector.
My reason for this is simple, they is no way of forming a complete build besides random luck.

All that said I did have fun playing and will keep playing but I suggest you wait for a few patches to come out before you buy the game.";11.3;0.0;2.0;306.0;Posted: March 30, 2020

I'd say it looks good, it sounds good, and plays good (well) too! The game gives you a-lot of room to plan out strategies and play your own style, though I must say not all of them are treated equally. For example, developing shields on the aylon cruiser (or really any ship that has gone deep into shield strats) does, at-least in my experience, more damage than the heavy destroyer. I could understand game-development wise if the HD was meant to be a ""challenge"" ship, but c'mon, a shield focused ship with supposedly weaker firepower is out-damaging a [Heavy] [Destroyer]? And don't get me started on the *survivability. (I'll give you a hint, the Aylon has a starting shield capacity of 45 if you include it's starting equipment, while the Destroyer has nothing besides a card that heals 8 hp once per combat.) Besides that personal gripe of mine, the game is superbly enjoyable, even on hardcore difficulty. P.s., I hope this game gets big enough for someone to put the Soulshaven Station (if that -is- it's name) theme out there, because that was Spelunky-shop levels of smooth.

Nice artwork, nice tunes... The only truly negative thing I can say about the game is its overreliance on RNG. I get it's meant to be a ""roguelike"" but the balance or lack thereof is all over the place. I can't begin to tell you the number of runs ended in the first sector because of several clusters of enemies that all spam their attacks and leave you at half or less health past the first encounter; then the sector one enemies that enjoy their 10 ~ 23 damage attacks.

Yes, enemy attack values vary wildly unlike yours which are static. Their 'Burn damage' also pierces/ignores your Shields/Block while yours can't do the same.

That said, it's still entertaining for what it is but if the talk about its balancing or lack of certain elements common to deckbuilders of this kind puts you off, I'd suggest waiting for a sale or watching someone else play it before deciding.";9.8;1.0;0.0;701.0;Posted: April 12

If you like the gameplay of ""Slay the spire"" and the scifi setting of ""FTL"" then you'd probably like this game. However, there are a few caveats.

1. VERY glitchy: I have had numerous occasions. HOWEVER, nothing has broken a run (IE, the UI broke, the event stopped working as usual, ect.) without being fixed by quitting to the main menu and just continuing. However, this has reset one event where I got an epic equipment and made it as if it didn't exist.

2. NO EASY STATUS ICON. if you get set on fire, you have to see it on the combat log. otherwise something happens and you wonder ""Why the heck did I lose a card this turn"" or ""Where did that 2 damage come from?""

However, in my time of playing, nothing has hampered the FTL-esque random encounter combat too badly and the combat (other than the occasional glitch that makes shields ""NON"", as well as the status thing.) too heavily.

overall, 7/10. quite fun in short bursts but can be a bit repetitive if playing for longer periods. Needs some updates and bug fixes but overall is fine.";39.7;1.0;0.0;65.0;Posted: April 4

It's not bad. It's a bit RNG heavy and bit light on content, but it isn't overly expensive. The pixel art and general gameplay mechanics are good. A bit of fleshing out and variety in both fights and encounters would help, along with a bit less of the aforementioned RNG. The fuel mechanic is kind of whatever if you have a good deck.";9.9;1.0;0.0;262.0;Posted: April 1

This is a pretty good game. I don't think it's better than pillars of the genre like Slay the Spire, but that's not a fair thing to expect. This game is enjoyable, and the sci-fi theme is a refreshing change from swords and wizards.

The art is fantastic. I really like the style.

Gameplay is solid. If you pay attention, you can find cards that work really well together, and that's the real joy of a deckbuilder.

All in all, I enjoy this game and plan on playing it more. So that's a thumbs up.


I have not seen any of the bugs other users have reported. I don't know if I've just been lucky or if they were all fixed in the 1.01 patch.

My biggest complaints are all UI-related. For example It's not always obvious what just happened. Some enemy attacks have clear animations, many don't. There's a text log in the upper left that I guess is supposed to solve this issue, but solving it visually would have been a lot better.

The map can also get a bit confusing. They put giant arrows on top of the sectors you can travel to, which sometimes makes them hard to see and understand. I don't know why the arrows are even there. We all understand what adjacent squares are. The arrows could probably disappear after the tutorial and it'd be fine.

Those are the kinds of complaints I have. Minor UI stuff. I see that other people are complaining about difficulty or ""RNG"", but those are all about where I expected them to be. I don't expect to beat a game like this on my first couple runs, and that's fine, so long as I have fun while I fail.";53.6;1.0;0.0;385.0;Posted: April 1

This game reminds me of the good times I had in Slay the Spire. If you like deckbuilding, this is a great game for you. Spire was the first game that got me into deckbuilding, but it felt too rigid and linear.

I lean on the side of recommending this game, however it seems like something about it makes me both love it and hate it. I enjoy the game play and the styling of it makes it enjoyable. But I feel like the art or game play just doesn't fit all together. Its not terrible, but it just seems like its lacking something. Like a song without a chorus. Feels like its got some good versus and its going somewhere, but it just doesn't feel complete.

I'd definitely keep this game on deck if you're on the fence about getting it, but if you feel like scratching an itch for some card battling then maybe this will be your scratch post.";0.4;1.0;0.0;816.0;Posted: March 30

Take one part FTL: Faster Than Light, and mix in a healthy helping of Slay the Spire, then add just a tiny pinch of Halcyon 5's graphical style and you get this roguelike deckbuilder card combat game set in space. While some of the strategies in the game appear to be more or less valid than others, there's enough there to make the time spent worth it. Overall the gameplay feels both familiar and fresh at the same time.

Early Access review: mostly entertaining but seems to make no attempt at balance. A balance pass will presumably come before the launch from Early Access (post-Early Access update: nope, no apparent attempts at balance). If the Heart of the Cards smiles on you, you will draw amazing combos for free or not need combos at all due to single-card win conditions. Or occasionally you will roll up to an enemy who will immediately attack for more damage than your hull+shields combined while you draw no defense.

This game has promise and will probably get better, but as of November 2021, it is not a game I can recommend.";5.9;0.0;0.0;1453.0;Posted: November 27, 2021

This game has a lot of potential. I dig the art style, and I like the gameplay. It can be seen that this is early access, there are some graphical inconsistencies (like loose anything that isn't pixelart from a pixelart game) and balance issues, and some cards doesn't work properly or not at all. Or the description of some cards not accurate, or just not contains enough info.
The ""deckbuilding"" part is strange to me, and this is what I didn't really liked. I can choose to have a card or not, I can hardly get rid of cards that I don't need, if I'm unlucky, I won't get the cards I need the most. So it has a lot of randomness to it. But what would Space RNJesus do? :D He would still recommend it and hope that in the future, the finished game will have more balance, and some more content and he would play through this game again.";37.0;1.0;0.0;266.0;Posted: November 22, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Conditional recommendation, buy it on sale.

I've played the game for over 20 hours, and it was fun, but quickly became repetitive, as the majority of cards are meh, so it is too easy to just choose a simple combo and stick to it.

Fuel is functionally unlimited if you take the fuel salvage drone card, which then you can sell your excess to rapidly get to 1,000+ credits and rapidly buy any upgrades and cards.

On the start of the 2nd map I'll spend virtually all of my credits just to cycle through all of the ship upgrades.

Take the cloak card, upgrade your ship with high level shield capacity, take the zero cost card that attacks with -2 max shield capacity, and add a few more if you want, but at that point you are not offered any significant challenge.

I think I just played my last game because I unlocked all of the ships except for one hidden one, the repetition wasn't worth it to play through the rest of the second board.

One big problem is the groups of ships are not varied, so on a given board you will keep facing only a few non-varied groups.

So, if you want something new that is reminiscent of FTL and Halcyon 6, if you get it on sale, maybe you might get 20-50 hours of new feeling fun, after which it will drop off into a grind.";26.5;1.0;0.0;813.0;Posted: September 17, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's a good work in process. It has fixed a lot of the issues it had since launch, and while I don't like the hidden limitation regarding how many cards you can play in one turn, it is a welcomed limitation.

So far, For The Warp doesn't offers much. It lacks character, real content, and a defined story or objective to follow. But it does have a LOT of potential and it is, for the most part, well balanced.

If all you want is a winning strategy, you can try to go for one of three possible decks. Carrier Deck, which is broken as all hell. Inverse Shield Damage deck, which can kill 300hp ships in a single hit later on. And Booster Deck, which is so fun and broken it's not even fair to the enemy. Just remember, look out for synergies and cards that let you draw fast and cheaply. But do whatever you can to get the Barrel Roll card, that's literally the best card in the game, period. With it, you have a 99% certainty to win. Also, keep you decks on a 8-14 cards limit, anything more it becomes useless, anything less, you are left powerless.

All in all, I give it a 8/10.";10.3;1.0;0.0;362.0;Posted: August 10, 2021

Fun, and actually has an interesting design.
That being said it's still unbalanced in alpha, its incredibly easy to force a build without consequence due to the enemies lacking enough impact.

I really enjoyed their deck design having no discard pool; you draw and discard to the same pool.
Even though there are a lot of crazy loops you can pull off, the number of cards you play is limited based on the number of cards in your original deck.

This means you can place higher value on cards that dissipate during the fight as it allows your refined combo deck more cards to play.

It would be interesting to see some balance around this aspect of the game via enemy auras and debuffs.";10.4;1.0;0.0;276.0;Posted: May 14, 2021

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Alright, I normally don't do reviews on Steam, however this game has made me make an exception. The easiest way for me to describe this game at the time of writing is FTL: Faster Than Light mixed with Slay the Spire with a slight influence from tactical rpg's. That being said, there are a few issues at the moment I have noticed, however it could just be my PC at the moment. First issue is in the intro cut-scene the audio jacks up near the end and transfers into the map. Second issue I found is the random encounter that shows all PoI (Places of Interest) on the map, causing a soft lock, however going to main menu then pressing continue resets the tile and allows you to continue playing. Third issue I found is when you run out of fuel, you click the arrow, the distress beacon dialogue appears in which you lose some credits and gain five fuel.

The combat is good. I like the shield system where you can rollover shields to next turn, unless you have the Kinetic Shield card or something else along those lines, however I will say the GUI during combat is not my friend. The GUI is beautiful, however there are no tool-tips except for equipment. If I ignite the enemy, I have to remember how much ignite is on the enemy, how much damage it might do, etc. I see the icon under the enemy, I just don't have any information to work with regarding that aspect.

Synergies is an interesting concept. I like them to be honest, and with the estimated 80 cards you're more likely to encounter synergy cards. It makes the actual deck-building fun, and you can get some pretty interesting combinations. If you find an Ignite synergy with Nova Strike it's beautiful.

Deck-building: In all honesty, I haven't messed around with this all too much. I have noticed that removing cards from your deck is a much more difficult process than adding cards to the deck. There's a few random encounters that allow you to remove cards, and it's a beautiful sight that makes a grown man cry with joy.

Overall, I would pick this game up if you like FTL and/or Slay the Spire. There's a few things that could deal with a bit of polish or reworking, but otherwise it's a good game.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'd recommend the game, with the caveat that it can be very frustrating, partly due to a few bugs, and how the game currently works.

I really enjoy building a deck, but it does feel too random in how you receive cards and equipment, even how you discard the cards is down to chance encounters - which makes trying to keep a lean deck really hard, unless you want pass on better cards to hold onto lots of weaker ones. Perhaps allowing the player to scrap more than one card at a time between gates, pay to ""refit"" at a shipyard,
(you can do this at big stations, but these are rare, and its very expensive so that only 1 or 2 cards are possible) or simply ""jettison"" equipment (it costs nothing, but you make nothing either) would help?

There are a few bugs:

* Occasionally pop up windows don't disappear - which can obscure the map and your ship, so you can't click to choose a direction (you can use WASD and QEZX as a workaround).
* WASD etc are not disabled when in at a space station, so it's possible to accidentally move, and exit the space station before you've done anything. Which isn't great since the space stations disappear after each visit.

Anyway, I hope that feedback helps make the game better. Despite all of the above I'm looking forward to future updates!";64.5;1.0;0.0;80.0;Posted: January 17, 2021

this game is super super promising, but there are a couple of run-killing issues with it. The main one being that there sometimes isn't an ""end"" to the game. You can build a deck that makes all the enemies in the final zone completely trivial, and then you can't actually LEAVE that zone because for whatever reason the warp gate is gone.

Once they fix this, and add a little more variety to the encounters (and I do only mean a little) it will be up there with legends of the genre like FTL.";10.6;1.0;0.0;79.0;Posted: January 3, 2021

I've only played on normal mode so far but everything seems balanced and enjoyably random.

Short but sweet little space deckbuilder. I fail to see the rouglelike/lite aspect (as different ships unlock when you defeat stage bosses), but that's really not a concern.

There is virtually no story here, so those wanting an in-depth or even light story as you crush your enemies won't find one here. This has more potential, and I hope that the developer does seek out more recommendations before official launch.

A nice game which lacks some polish at the moment. You have too little control over the gameplay as the few possible combos depend on getting the required cards by luck. The replay factor needs improvement, too, as you can only unlock 3(4?) ship hulls but no powerfull cards or something similiar for the next round. Currently there are only a few (5?) levels/star systems which make the game very short. Nevertheless I enjoyed it and hope for a DLC and the needed improvements.";5.7;1.0;0.0;1287.0;Posted: August 23, 2020

Pros:
Good core mechanics, if unpolished and a bit clunky in execution atm.
Good play dynamic with the right additions I could see this being something I would heavily play and return to later; not sure if it has the full potential of FTL/Slay the Spire but it could depending on further developments.

Cons:
Feels like it has 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards necessary to make it reasonably dynamic.
Lacks the item variation and customization of Slay the Spire [though if you could upgrade to slot more equipment and/or they added basic ship upgrades of some sort.]
Only system variation seems to be enemies [no FTL environmental dangers, or crew flavor]
Deck randomization does functionally only reward a small deck

I started the journey as a lowly tarnished, with only the guidance of grace to guide me on a perilous path of struggle, hardship and suffering. I stumbled, I failed and I died. I came back up again, learning from my mistakes.
In the journey, I faced many great enemies. Some I admired and respected while some I loathed and hated, yet thankful for them all.
I made friends, learned from teachers, faced-off adversaries, fell in love, cried in loss, and shared on the happiness of each and every characters of the game. For those who may call me their consort, their lambkin, their tarnished, or even their lord; i express my thanks.

This game was my second entry to fromsoftwares, ( the first being sekiro), and I am at a loss of words to express the emotional rollercoaster I went through during my playthroughs. I now understand why their games are so well-celebrated and has such a vast community.

Elden Ring isn’t perfect.

Comparing this game to other FromSoftware products one aspect after another it’s clear that Elden Ring isn’t as smooth as Sekiro, doesn’t have bosses like Dark Souls, and its story isn’t as good as Bloodborne, but looking this way at anything will make no sense, you simply do not order salad in Subway and then put one star review saying that they refused to sell you a salad.

Elden Rings lore and story.

Game’s still fresh, Vaatividya still works on lore, and so far we barely can piece together coherent explanation to what happened before we set foot in Lands Between. It offers some similarities to ideas that Dark Souls used before, and it’s open for speculations as much.
As for the story of the game, we’re thrown in fractured world only hundred years after The Shattering, war that no demigod came out victorious leaving Lands Between in stalemate.
We’re tarnished, once stripped from the grace of Greater Will and exiled, coming back to Lands Between, resurrected and yet again guided by the very grace we were stripped from, with one goal – to become the Elden Lord.

World of Elden Ring.

To summarize how big Lands Between are I will say only this:
Elden Ring world is made up from five main parts on surface level, this already sounds like enormous place. But wait, there’s more – each part has legacy dungeons, big structures that player can get lost for hours and still be surprised revisiting the place. There are also catacombs, minor erdtrees, ruins, villages, and so on. It is very densely packed and it gives hours upon hours of additional content to go through. Still not enough? There is literally 3 major underground locations, each bigger than the last one. And for the dessert - whole legacy dungeon floating above the sea near the coastline of Lands Between.
It is big, but is it pleasant to look at?
To answer that we can go back and look at last two games made by FromSoftware, Sekiro and Dark Souls 3, and precisely Fountainhead Palace and Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. FromSoftware seems to like dragging players through countless swamps and catacombs, difficult bosses, and whatnot to build up the hatred towards another location that we might need to go through to finish the game, and then every negative emotion leaves the body, because we’re presented with what’s called ‘the best area in the game aesthetically’, that’s the case with Irithyll, that’s the case with Fountainhead palace, and that’s the case with… nearly every legacy dungeon in Elden Ring. Progressing through the world of this game is like going the best location in one souls game to another best location from different game.
I think there also is beauty in elevation, and Elden Ring does exceptional job at that too. Lands Between are not flat, they’re constantly changing elevation as we progress through the game, but not only between main parts of the map, also between locations in those parts.
FromSoftware creates dark fantasy and I, personally, think that currently there’s no one in the industry better at doing so.



The most important part for some, especially if advertised as ACTION RPG. Just a reminder, you’re Tarnished, a nobody with a simple task to become the Elden Lord, against various demigods, with a stick and wooden shield. The game is not easy. It is not the hardest FromSoftware game, but it’s still hard, especially for newcomers.
What to expect? Dying, a lot. Elden Ring, like any From game has no difficulty slider, there’s one difficulty – Get Gud. Fortunately for Tarnished, Elden Ring provides a lot of different mechanics to ease the pain such as: magic, summons, broken status buildup (bleed, cold), co-op, cheesing, and last, but not least (for PC) – modding. There already are mods to change the difficulty by lowering health and attack damage of nearly everything in Elden Ring. To experience the game the best way though is to go through it yourself, learn to fight, optimize your build and try again, because there’s no better feeling in FromSoftware games than beating hard boss yourself.
Will you get bored? I don’t think there’s a chance to get bored in this game, even with such simple combat mechanics, because there’s also variety of builds, with easily over 200, probably even more weapons, over 100 armor sets for your fresh Elden Bling, and many more configurations with new addition – Ashes of War. If that’s not enough, let’s talk about variety of enemies. Remember seeing total of 19 enemies in God of War from 2018, winner of Game of the Year? There’s over 140 unique enemy types in the game that are vastly different from each other (except for reskins, not many of them though). Also, rats are back, now with madness status to make your life even more miserable. There’s actually a lot of enemies that you will hate with passion, you will go on reddit and vent about it, and you will see that vast majority of players also hate them.


TLDR : The game is the only rightful choice for Game of the Year.";295.7;1.0;13.0;130.0;Posted: 12 May

I really don't know what to say. On the one hand i really enjoyed this game, but on the other hand some things are just bad and it took my enjoyment away. Elden Ring is basically a combination of all previous souls games made by From Software, and i really like that. It has mechanics from previous souls games for example: Power stance from Dark Souls 2.
I was really hyped for the game, i even platinued previous games from Demon's Souls to Sekiro.
I completed the game multiple times, got all achievements, collected every single weapon, armor piece, talismans and so on.
I really enjoyed most things. Game is beatuful, all places look fantastic, the art style is top notch.

But unfortunately game has many problems. My main problem is that the game works like sh*t. It has terrible performance. The game stutters basically all the time. There are many fps drops. CPU goes into 100% for no reason at random moments, even while standing still. Even on ps5 the game had many fps drops and stutters (i don't know how it works on ps5 now, i was playing on day 1 patch).

Another thing i really don't like are boss fights. Elden Ring has over 100 bosses. The thing is that you will fight with the same boss for a few times. Sekiro had the same thing, but you would fight with same boss just twice. When i saw Crucible Knight for the first time, i was enjoying the fight, it was not hard but also it was not easy. The bad thing is that you will fight the same Crucible Knight or Watchdog few times. I would rather have less but more unique bosses, because it really feel's lazy at times. There are also really unfair fights like duo bosses in the game, for example: Crucible Knight Duo. Also all those enemies really have long combos, and after they're done then maybe you will hit them once or twice. While in ds3 for example you could hit them during combos to punish them.



There are also input problems. Sometimes our character will not attack or roll. Roll has a weird half of a second delay and when you get hit, game remembers that you pressed dodge button and our character rolls on his own and because of that we can get hit again. I died many times because of that and it is really aggravating.

Overall, the game is really good, it's nice to just explore big open world. Even though the game has many problems i was enjoying it. But i can't recommend it right now. Day one patch worked better, it had fps drops but that's all. Patch 1.04 has those cpu problems. Very often it is just unplayable, and the only fix is to restart a pc. I really hope From Software will fix the performance. When they fix it, i will change my decision.

Welcome to Dark Souls 4
Subtitle: It's not different at all, is it, Steve?

Elden Ring is an open-world Action/RPG game, emphasizing over-the-shoulder camera work behind your character, the Tarnished. There is much to say about Elden Ring, but little space in this review to cover it all. It is easy to say ""Elden Ring is Dark Souls 4"", but only veterans of Dark Souls will understand that meaning fully. What does that mean to new players to the franchise? Elden Ring is a knock out success in that regard, with much newblood appearing.

Weight is the essence of Dark Souls design: your character has gravity, many attacks are done in realistic ways, fantastical magics exist but are limited in scope, and the overall pacing is slow but gradual. In many respects it can be called 'low fantasy', emphasizing realism in much of what it does, only to selectively break that for incredible effects. Those who are familiar with The Elder Scrolls series will also recognize this model of design.

Elden Ring's art style reflects heavy western fantasy themes: grittiness, decay, but also beauty, fantastical architecture, and things both sane and bizarre, all walk hand in hand together. While it is not pushing graphical realism to its hardest, the distinct visual style delivers a consistent atmosphere to the world. Every area carries a theme, purpose, and vision that tells a story all of its own. In this respect, Elden Ring happily uses environmental story telling in much of what it is.

Varied musical scores and arrangements follow the almost purely instrumental sound track. Ambient pieces follow alongside epic arrangements for things like Boss Battles, creating a dynamic landscape that is, itself, evocative of its world. Elden Ring's, in my opinion, hits pretty average with few notable outliers; all are worthwhile to listen to, but few I went out of my way to make note of.

The narrative experience is, itself, the heart of all things Dark Souls; so all things are shaped by it. You are the Tarnished, a no-name nobody, misbegotten soul who returned to life. You are guided by a simple purpose: to overthrow the rulers of old, acquire their power, and establish yourself as the ruler of a new age. To do so, you will travel through a dead, dying, or decrepit world on its last legs.

As all around you succumb to the failings of the past, you and few others are all that dare to change this gloomy status quo. How you will, of course, will vary. The end of one age brings forth another, and so many forces that survived are vying to make it *their* new age. Who you help will have just as much an effect on the outcome of everything.

Pound for pound, Elden Ring and its Dark Souls siblings buries an entire world in its deep lore. Plot information scattered through items, chance encounters, one-off-lines by NPCs, and the like. You are, by design, encouraged to sift through and recover these lost bits. To find out the 'truth' of what happened, who these people are, and the world they once lived in. You won't ever have a perfect picture, but you will get one eventually. You could go all the way and know nothing at all, if you so choose.

I will say, Elden Ring did disappoint me in this regard. It is lockstep with its Dark Souls siblings, showing zero innovation or change in how its plot delivers and NPC questlines work. This is especially frustrating as, being an open world game, an NPC could (and has) literally hide in the corner of the world, 100% missable. Some will even die or disappear if you continue to play the game without finding them, vanishing into smoke and never telling you that you failed to progress their questlines. I continue to regard this as an inherently bad design, but using a wiki to find the information may spoil the quest lines.

As you fight through the Lands Between, you acquire runes, the universal currency used for everything including leveling up. Through runes, and gathered materials, you can craft useful combat items, talk to smiths to upgrade your weapons (armor doesnt need it), and level up to improve your overall power. Some varieties in play styles are present, usually flavors of melee and ranged combat added together. Elden Ring as a whole favors melee, and ranged is usually a supplementary style. Magic varies greatly, but it is notably better than other Souls games in being a viable main class choice.

Of the combat, I choose to criticize what is known as the 'Artorias' problem.

A Super Boss from Dark Souls 1 DLC, Artorias was outrageously popular as a 'mold' breaking boss, being extremely fast, tactical, and responsive to the player. FromSoft has become addicted to replicating Artorias ever since, putting his pattern behavior in many different bosses. This is especially notable in Elden Ring's late game bosses, who all have insane response times, massive damage, and long windows of 'dodge or die' forced upon the player. Rather than be uniquely distinctive, they all feel like different versions of Artorias. Thankfully, many of the early and mid-game bosses didn't show this behavior, and none of them were outstanding issues to me.

I will make notable exception of Elden Ring's ""hardest"" boss:

Elden Ring is a good game, and a worthy addition to the Souls family. Breaking off into its own narrative universe has interesting future implications, as the Dark Souls storyline itself has been 'wrapped up'. As a combat-focused Action-RPG, it delivers well on balancing real time attacks with the idea of making character builds and play styles. You need both in order to survive to the end.

The open world design is perhaps surprising/welcome to newcomers, but it is almost a perfect venn diagram of older Souls designs. Instead of long narrow tunnels that branch like a spider web, you have big open fields instead. All the dungeons and the like are still there, and are very classically Souls-like, just much shorter in length. I don't hate this change of pace; better than many other games that try to become 'open world', Elden Ring (and Souls) feels perfectly in sync with it.

As a final, personal note: I wish they did more with the storyline. FromSoft, like Artorias above, is addicted to their own formula, and has shown zero variation or improvements. More in depth NPC questlines, more creating of one's new 'ruling faction', and more of a world we can participate in, are all things I'd like to see. Much of what you do in Elden Ring can be summarized as ""receiving a post-it note with instructions"" and exploring every cave you see in trying to finish those instructions.

Elden Ring asks the question: how would an open world Dark Souls work? And then answers it around 50 hours in: it doesn't. The world design and atmosphere are stunning, but the scale of the whole game is simply too large to be filled with the limited gameplay it actually offers.

The game counts almost single-handedly on your desire to scour the world for equipment as an incentive to drive forward and uncover characters, lore, and directional clues -- but character builds are centered around your equipment, and 95% of what's in the (very, very large and detailed) world isn't actually useful for the character you're playing. It's only compounded by the fact that most armour is balanced to be roughly equal, and if you're counting on your exploration rewarding you with a cool new armour upgrade to replace your starter set, you're going to be very, very disappointed.

This approach probably would have worked if the scaling of enemy rune drops was fine tuned, with side bosses offering meaningful character level boosts so that if the piece of gear they drop is irrelevant, the player still feels rewarded. Before long, however, I was playing for the charm and exploration for its own sake rather than gameplay itself -- a dangerous position for a very lengthy experience to find itself in.

Combat, as always, is quite good, and some of the main boss fights (particularly the earlier story ones) were a hoot. Unfortunately, the balance inevitably turns into a sort of glass cannon experience in which everything including you does high damage and has little health/armour, so even major boss fights are quick and frustrating when you die, and then punctuated by being over very quickly when you happen to get a good hit and win. In this way, many of my wins felt like big anti-climaxes by midgame. I think if the game scaled damage down and reduced your available healing pool significantly, it would make for slightly more drawn out battles in which putting in the effort to learn a boss's moves would be more rewarding, and winning would be more satisfying.

The other core element that translated badly to the large open world is the storytelling, which stubbornly sticks to the traditional Souls-like formula of a detailed world with a threadbare plot that drip-feeds info and lore and leaves it to the player to interpret. That's all sort of interesting and works brilliantly in a tight, semi-linear game with clear progression, but in a vast open world I found myself needing some kind of dramatic tension, sense of urgency, personal stake or at least clear understanding of why I was doing what I was doing, and Elden Ring doesn't deliver that sort of experience -- at least, not where I'd gotten up to. I was disappointed to realise I'd had enough and become bored after clearing Limgrave+Liurnia+Caelid regions. From what others have said, however, the latter half of the game feels even more of a slog.

Finally, the social element of leaving messages isn't really working well, with the vast majority of messages being from mouthbreathers copying each others jokes about buttholes and Fortnite all around the map and presumably patting themselves warmly on the back afterward. The community sense of discovery and sharing, which in some cases is essential due to the game's obscure design, is greatly Tarnished by this, such that toward the end of my play I was avoiding reading messages altogether.

Elden Ring isn't a bad game -- it just isn't quite the big deal it wants to be. There's fun to be had here and it's probably worth grabbing the game and playing it through using a guide instead of trying to discover everything yourself and burning out. That said, I think next time I have a hankering, I'll be picking up Dark Souls instead, and I'm not ""recommending"" this on balance.";106.3;0.0;7.0;111.0;Posted: May 8

It is a fun game but the constant invasions just slapping you down that far out scale you is beyond disgusting. The blatant mod downloading that bypasses EAC that hurts online isn't caught but apparently cosmetics are. (Note I have not downloaded any mods that last part is heresay to be fair.) Easy anti cheat slows down the game but somehow doesn't catch any of these. From you have made 5 games like this I know you can do better please!

After years of waiting, Elden Ring does not disappoint representing the cumulation of all the things FromSoft has learned over the recent decades, taking and refining previous ideas to perfection. Elden Ring possesses an unparalleled level of exploration, gorgeous terrain, well hidden secrets and incredible boss fights making it one of the most compelling open worlds ever. Aside from some reused content and poor balancing of certain aspects of the PvP and PvE, this game remains a masterpiece of both RPGs and open world games alike.";355.3;1.0;4.0;165.0;Posted: May 9
ELDEN RING;"Posted: May 9
I really enjoyed this game. I'm a fan of FROM's games, so while I was confident they'd make an good game, I was worried that the move to an open world format would diminish some of their other strengths. I think instead they were able to show new strengths, creating an open world that will be a new standard by which to compare others going forward.

The gameplay is much like other FROM games, though I did appreciate the effort they made to make it more varied, and even in their own way make it more accessible through additional gameplay options. Between the many new options in this game like Spirit Summons, and the resurrect ability in Sekiro, you can tell FROM has been looking at ways of giving players alternative methods to overcome the difficulties in their games in smart ways that don't compromise their design and aren't a bland difficulty slider that changes the game globally. PVP seems to have improved feature-wise, however the times I have played it I found it to suffer from a lot of lag. It's hard to tell if this is caused by players or the game, but it's extremely common and makes PVP less enjoyable than it could be.

I found the bosses to be overall easier than in previous games, with some notable exceptions where it seemed FROM was almost making a point to show they can still make a hard as hell boss fight when needed.

The world design makes incredible use of scale, and the areas have a good amount of variety, both in terms of types of environment but also in terms of the enemies within and the content density. The first few areas are packed with places to explore and things to find, while some of the latter areas are a bit more sprawling and sparse. I didn't care for some as much as others, like the blinding snowfield, but with so much, that's bound to be the case. The enemy variety is worth noting too. Someone recently counted them up and found that Elden Ring had more enemy types than Breath of the Wild, AC: Valhalla, Ghost of Tsushima, and Horizon Forbidden West combined.

The emphasis on open world does mean a bit of a step down in terms of the small scale level design. Many of the past games, Dark Souls 1 in particular is renowned for its incredible interlocking vertical layered approach to the world. Elden Ring does have a bit of this in spurts in areas the community has taken to calling Legacy Dungeons, but not quite to the same extent.

The graphics are a huge step up in quality for FROM. Basically look at any screenshot of the landscape and it would probably make an amazing wallpaper. FROM has always had a good artistic eye for presenting the player with interesting focal scenes, and having an open world just allowed them to do that all the more. Characters designs are largely the same as past games. Passable, but not their strong suit, particularly with the faces. And as ever, the character creator is very difficult to work with, perhaps even the hardest boss in the game.

The UI is very much a FROM software UI. There are some quality of life improvements, like sorting and some better presentation of information, but it is what it is.

The armor is very cool, but for all the variety I kept hoping there would be more. Maybe it’s a case where there's just never enough, but knowing how big of a deal fashion is, I keep hoping they'll lean into it more. The armor alteration system is interesting, but it almost feels like it wasn't fully fleshed out, as in most cases (with some notable exceptions), it's just about removing the cloak. In the future, at the least, it would be nice to see color palette changes as an additional option.

As far as the lore of the world goes, this is probably the best realization of FROM's style of presenting lore in the abstract but discernable through the world and items you find, and the lore of this world is very interesting to learn about as you go through the game.

Quests are a bit of a mixed bag. I enjoyed the content of the quests, such as there is. I'm not opposed to FROM's typical minimalist quest design. FROM tends to not treat quests as traditional RPG quests, but more as fleeting ephemeral experiences with characters, and things you do in the world may or may not advance your relationship with them, much like life. I get that. However, there is also a good argument to be made that it's still a game. At the very least if you're going this route, with a system where the conditions for advancement are not transparent, then you need those quests to be reliable, flexible, and bug free, and I feel like in the game's current state this is lacking.

Many times there are quests that behave in unexpected ways, or only via exceedingly strict conditions. For instance, I had one quest that would not advance until I had rested at one specific site of grace. No other site of grace would do, and this one was not obviously associated with the events. I had another case where a bug preventing a character from speaking with me, that had me spending time trying to figure out what I was missing (fortunately this was fixed in patch 1.04).

I kind of wonder if a lot of the non-mainline quest content was added at the very end of development and that's the cause of these issues. I get that feeling because even as of the most recent patch, new stages to quest chains are still being added, which is pretty unusual. Unfortunately, combined with the previous issues, this also leads to problems. There is one new quest line with a new character announced in the patch notes that I am unable to even begin because of a non-quest related action that I took before they were added to the game. In short, I'm open to the way FROM designs quests, but I think they fell short of what they were going for.

Ultimately, these complaints don't detract from the overall experience which is still pretty amazing. I highly recommend this game and look forward to future DLC.";255.8;1.0;2.0;1876.0;Posted: May 9

TLDR: A fantastic game. Great story and gameplay. I would say 10/10.

I am not a hardcore fan of the souls-like genre. I decided to buy Elden Ring along with my friend at first only because Dark Souls 3 servers went down. I was planning to buy it anyway, but wanted to finish DS3 first. But I do not regret the purchase at all. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blast to play, in solo and in coop.

Story and Gameplay:
I’ll talk about the story first. Souls games are always a bit hard to understand in terms of story, which makes it better for me because it makes me want to pay attention and keep talking to characters from time to time to keep myself updated on the story progression. The best part is, you can do the story at your own pace from any point of start. I did the first boss way later than I was supposed to. The game rewards exploration, and expects you to do it since it does not tell you where to go, which is another aspect I love about this game. The gameplay progression is really satisfying. The joy you get when a build that you’ve been investing on pays off, is super nice. The music is an under appreciated aspect of this game. The ambient music for each area is really good, and all the boss tracks that I've experienced so far, are amazing.

:
Online experience is really good. Coop is really fun. Mixing up moves and supporting each other in fights is really good. I would even say it makes the game a bit easier, but that’s where the PvP comes in. Invasion is the aspect of the game which I love and hate at the same time. It's a very unique experience. You can even help other players as a hunter. If anyone else gets invaded, you can be summoned as a Hunter in their world to help the host. So, you'll always find matches for it, in case you want to get the game for it's PvP aspect.

:
Of course, there are downsides to the game too. Some invaders are super laggy, which makes for unfair matches and connection errors for no reason when playing coop ruins the experience a bit. But it’s not too much of a hindrance. If the game is difficult for you, then you need to get good. As long as you are patient enough to read the enemy movements and time your attacks, you can beat any enemy. I know it’s such an obvious statement to say, but that’s the only way to beat this game.

Overall, It’s a fantastic game. I haven’t even finished my first playthrough. I have only finished like 40-50% of the main story and I am close to 200 hours already. I hope that speaks for the amount of content that’s in this game. If you ask me, the full price is totally worth it. But if you want to get it on a sale, that’s fine too. But, I’d definitely recommend it to anyone.";210.1;1.0;2.0;169.0;Posted: May 12

One of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. The combat is the best of any Souls game, giving you TONS of options on how to play. Crazy spells, summons, weapon arts, power stancing, jumping, all the talismans you can mix around, shields aren't totally dumb. That by itself is great, but the world is the biggest and best of any game. So much to explore, so many secrets, so beautiful EVERYWHERE.

Just...get this game. If you like Dark Souls, get this game. If you haven't liked Dark Souls in the past...give it a shot and be patient with it. You won't win every fight, but once you accept and learn how to get better, you can find out how crazy, crazy good this game is.";166.2;1.0;3.0;114.0;Posted: May 8

First of all, I suppose it's not a masterpiece game, like others saying, just because of the open world and some in game mechanics reuse. Second, I'm not a huge fan of souls(but I have Bloodborne platinum). Babadzaki made me suffer, until I found a jumping farm option. But.. Guys I'm observing the AAA game segment and it's not that clear. Nowadays, a number a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games are coming, and what to conceal, we will gain more in future. In this case, we have here no more just a game, but the only industry hope. Cyberpunk died in the childhood, Ubisoft making mobile games, EA making football casino, so who can save gamers?
I can say only one thing, we need to buy games like Elden Ring. To show investors we are interested in such mediaproduct. We don't give a hell about mobile gaming, we need epic, tough singleplayer games!

It's hard to describe why Elden Ring is so, so good.
Yet, it's so incredibly easy.

Why? We just need to look at the core attitude of Elden Ring, from a design-to-player perspective.
Elden Ring is challenging. Yes, that much is clear. But it's not to laugh at you or to discourage you.
It's hard because it knows what you're capable of, and it believes in you. It doesn't want you to give up.

Despite killing you all the time, it respects your intelligence and holds you of the highest regard. Elden Ring wants you to succeed, and this gives it the framework to do so many things right.

In that regard, Elden Ring does hold your hand in many aspects, than past games. but The story and lore of the world will completely pass you by if you don't take the time to read item descriptions, examine the world, and talk to every NPC you meet. You will be torn apart if you don't take the time to familiarize yourself with your weapon and shield. Most of all, if you don't take your time, you will be seeing YOU DIED a lot as well. The game grounds itself in patient manner when it comes to enemies and bosses: it wants you to slow down, weigh all of your options, experiment, and most importantly do whatever it takes to survive.

Combat is quick, but weighty; everything about the fighting is spot on. Small weapons swing fast like they should. Large weapons swing slow, and when they hit the ground they emit satisfying ""clunk"" sounds. Every swing depletes a certain amount of stamina. It's a simple mechanic but it puts so much choice and consequence on the player. You can try to attack like a madman to burn your enemies down as fast as you can, but you won't be able to hold a block with your shield if you run low on stamina. All of this goes double for the intense boss fights - most of the bosses won't hold anything back and they will be a true test of applying everything you've learned thus far. You will die, a lot, but finally defeating one of these bosses grants you such an immense feeling of accomplishment, because YOU DID IT ALL WITH YOUR OWN SKILL!

The world of Elden Ring is completely open world. There are very few loading screens, there are no transitional airlocks between areas; everything is seamlessly connected to each other. At times, the geography will seem strange but once you take a look around and realize that you can actually see areas from other places, suddenly everything feels natural. Elden Rings' atmosphere is done with careful and precise attention. Fromsoft uaed veryvspecial techniques with the color wheel to get every area perfectly.

At times you'll be exploring dark, moody caverns, other times you'll be wading through a dense, moonlit forest with nothing but the ambience to accompany you. Sometimes you'll even find yourself deep in the middle of a trap filled fortress. Make sure you always have your wits about you and you're actively paying attention. The world is just flat out beautiful and knowing that the game is one big connected overworld makes it feel so real and alive, and it really drives home the sense that this world is huge and it brings back that ""adventure"" experience I've come to miss so bad. The world is yours, and you're free to go wherever you please. At times, you might feel like you're a bit lost, and I do admit the game is sometimes a little obscure with the regard of pointing you towards the right direction, but there are subtle clues and hints. Are the enemies too hard in a certain area? Is there a locked door? There's probably another way you haven't explored yet.

The world is also home to many NPCs. I mentioned before that if you don't take the time to talk to the NPCs you meet and try to piece together who they are, what they're doing, and how they got where they are, you're going to miss out of a lot of Elden Ring' story. This is where I feel Elden Ring' thematic focus comes full strength. The entire game is about overcoming, and fighting through your own struggles. In that same sense, all of the characters you meet along the way are also fighting for something. Something they thought was important, or something they hold dear. Really, take the time to get to know these people and pay attention as well. You won't know where they go next if you don't listen! With that said, if you make the effort to witness each of these stories, you'll watch them struggle along with you, fighting their own battles. Yes, DElden Ring is rich with lore and backstory, but I think the real beauty is watching these characters fight for what they believe in, while you yourself are fighting your own battles too.

Elden Ring also has a very unusual multiplayer system. At all times, your character will be in either one of two forms: Tarnished or human. This enables you to partake in jolly co-operation! If you're in an area where you haven't beaten the boss yet, you can summon fellow players to your world who are also in the same area, as long as they're relatively near your soul level. Sounds good right? Just like the combat, there's another consequence you might have to face when you turn human. Elden Ring allows players to ""invade"" the worlds of other human players. They will appear as red phantoms, and they will hunt you down and kill you on sight, essentially marking this game's version of PvP.

Now, this is where I feel Elden Ring' biggest community strength comes from. You see, once a player invades you, all bets are off. They might be insanely twinked out. They might be a fair fight. They might want to honor duel you. You might even have a couple friends already summoned to help you out. Some players have taken it upon themselves to create a sort of ""honor"" code when it comes to PvP. They like to designate certain areas of the game for official dueling, with no help from other players or no healing, stuff like that. Some players agree with doing this. Some players prefer the chaotic nature of invading in random places, not knowing what either party will be up against. Some players are firmly rooted in the idea that PvE and PvP should not intertwine.. What ""honor"" or ""etiquette"" should be included in Elden Ring' PvP, if any, is still being debated today. I feel like there will never be one solid answer but I think that's okay. It allows for more discussion and I think there's something inherently beautiful about a community being on two complete opposite sides of how an in-game mechanic should work. Bottom line: try, at least a couple times, to play through the game in human form. The invasion mechanic is a part of the game, and even though sometimes you'll get ganked, it's an experience quite like no other.

Eldne Ring is challenging, but not unfair. To be honest, the difficulty this game is notorious for isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. Don't get me wrong though, there is still a lot of obstacles you'll have to overcome and at times it'll feel like you're stuck. But don't give up. Never give up.

In today's world of modern game development, it's very pleasant to play a game that actually holds you with a high regard and respects your ability to think, perceive, and act. Elden Ring is a hallmark of intelligent and masterful gameplay design, and it stands as one of my all time favorite games. Highly recommended. Well, now you know... and I can die with hope in my heart.";125.4;1.0;2.0;230.0;Posted: May 12

You've asked for it. From Software delivered. Just not the way you've wanted. If you asked me to describe Elden Ring I would say ""Dark Souls with easy mode"", but of course that's out to make some people really mad so I would have to rephrase. ""Elden Ring is dark souls for everyone"" might save my head, hopefully. But even besides what happens to my head. I feel like From Software did add an ""easy mode"" to Dark Souls with this Elden Ring. Just not the way ""Game journalists"" wanted. Instead of adding a slider in settings that changed difficulty from ""NIGHTMARE, LEGEND, SOMETHING BADASS"" to ""EASY, CASUAL, SOMETHING NOT SO COOL"" based on what the game designers feel the tone of the game should be From Software instead created an open world where even though the start of the game feels like any other souls game (walk three steps...and..., boss fight.). With Elden Ring, From Software says ""Hey, Here's an open world and there is an easy mode in it. Go find it if you want it!"". Once you get past the tutorial section (that has a boss fight as well, but not really) you enter the open world where you can find items that not only make the game easier, but also kind of fight things for you. In the end it just comes down to how hard or easy you want the game to be. I personally found myself constantly making the game easier even though I knew I could beat it without those functions which lead to frustration, but that's just me. I know some players personally who either don't have the capacity or the willpower to torture themselves like I do so those functions make the game enjoyable for them. Besides the items and the world they've also removed single player invasions so players can take their time exploring and farming runes without random invaders appearing and sending their sou---runes to the abyss. I feel like sometimes doing your own thing can lead to great things and From Software has proven that you really don't need to follow all the trends and do things like others do to appeal to the masses (or perhaps old men in black suits). Sometimes siting down and improving how you already do things results in a far better outcome and Elden Ring proves that.

To be honest i was kinda scared with all the hype, that this game would end up being another Cyberpunk incident. However, this was not the case.
The game is pretty fantastic and every souls player will feel right at home. The world is huge and looks stunning, you have more freedom to explore than ever before and there are a ton of builds that can be tried out.
The game is also more accessible for new players and it can be the easiest out of all souls games or one of the hardest.
Please keep in mind that i do think the game is great but in my eyes it does have quite some issues that should be adressed.

The balancing of weapons is bad at times which is also a reason why this game is really only as hard as you make it for yourself. There are bleed builds that are OP, mages with Comet Azur, Sword of night and flame, quite a few war ashes that are broken and ofc the spirit ashes, most notably the mimic tear. The thing is that the spirit ashes are an important mechanic in the game because the bosses really have small attack windows so if you fight them without a spirit to split the aggro, it becomes pretty frustrating at times. And i don't mean in a good way but actually in a way were you feel like it is unfair.

I don't personally play PVP but from what i have seen certain builds dominate clearly which is also again a balancing issue.

For the first few hours the game feels really fresh and it instills a desire for exploration that i haven't had from any other game. There are so many dungeons, each with a boss at the end and a reward. But then at some point you realize that in each region the dungeons are pretty much the same and not only that, but that bosses get recycled over and over again.
I get that there are so many dungeons and you can't just design 100 unique bosses for each and every one of them , but at least don't recycle the bosses that are in an actual boss arena outside of dungeons. And just throwing two guys together and sell it as a new boss fight is also lazy and they have done that countless times.

Also i do like gigantic enemies but the issue is that as melee those fights are always annoying because you can't see anything that is going on or what the enemy is doing. I do not know how to fix that, maybe the camera has to zoom out, but that ♥♥♥♥ is irritating.

And last but not least, i do know that fromsoft intentionally doesn't give you a lot of information on how to progress and how to finish quests. That might have been fine for all the games, but since this game is not even remotely linear and you can get sidetracked in doing other stuff for hours it would've been useful to get some sort of journal that tracks the dialogue with NPC's that you have encountered because there are many of them, they all give you vague descriptions and not everyone can just remember all that.

This might sound like a lot of harsh criticism but in the end the game is still great and absolutely worth playing. There aren't a lot of games that have that much freedom and so many possibilities to play the game. And if you never played a souls game before don't get discouraged everyone can do it and despite what some people might say, there is no wrong way to play the game, just play it in a way that is fun for you.";141.6;1.0;1.0;25.0;Posted: May 10

After beating Elden Ring in roughly 85 hours (I tried to do as much side content as possible), I find my thoughts on it very scattered and conflicting. This makes deciding whether to recommend it or not very challenging because a recommendation is a very binary thing, either you should or should not spend your money on it. In the end, I’m going to give it a thumbs down not because I dislike it or because I think it’s a bad game but because it is a phenomenal game that is fundamentally flawed to the point where it will ruin enjoyment for all but the most committed Dark Souls fans. Apologies, this is going to be a bit of a ramble so if you’d like to see if it’s worth reading or you’d like a TL;DR skip to the end.

To start with the positives, the game is visually stunning, not to the level of the Demons Souls remake mind you, but stunning nonetheless. The vistas and overall world design present that of a land worth exploring. It is one of the few open world games I’ve played that take advantage of the world it exists in. The combat is very well polished and is a straight improvement from the already streamlined Dark Souls 3 with the addition of jumping attacks and even more unique weapons and spells to play around with. “Vitality” as a stat has been removed and equip load and resistances have been baked into “Endurance” again which itself has been nerfed because stamina and stamina regen are much more forgiving in the game making it a less necessary investment than it was in the original Dark Souls. The first third of the game is much more welcoming to new players, more than any other Souls game I’ve played and the reason for that is because of the open world design. “Easy mode” in Dark Souls has always been the leveling system. The more you explore, the more experience and skill levels you get to make later fights easier, and Elden Ring expands upon that with its open world. In a game like Dark Souls 3, if you can’t get past Dancer of the Boreal Valley there’s not much else you can do besides continue slamming your head into a wall until you win or give up. In Elden Ring, every main boss can be avoided temporarily so if you don’t feel confident in taking them on at your current level you can go explore elsewhere and feel like you’re making progress.

However, and here is where I’ll start to go into the negatives, this design philosophy is the seed from which many of my problems with the game evolve from. Because of the freedom to choose where to go, many things get very difficult to balance very quickly. It’s hard to craft rewards and challenges the always meet the player at where they currently are in their leveling. Boss difficulty is an obvious example, but another even more impactful one is the rune economy (experience for leveling up), which is frankly, completely bananas. There’s no telling if an enemy will give you 100, 1000, or 10000 runes. Whereas in other games where the more difficult the challenge, the greater the reward, in Elden Ring it feels completely random. This problem also exacerbates the variations in skill level people will be at in different parts of the game. So, if you play like me and want to explore every cove and mountain, which the game encourages you to do, you will be incredibly overleveled for the first two-thirds of the game and difficulty will be most sapped out of it. Pair this with the fact that while the world is huge and varied the enemies and most especially the bosses are not. Catacombs, caves, and mines are fun until you realize 90% of them have repeat bosses or basic enemies scaled up to boss level health and damage. Hope you like fighting the watchdogs because you will fight that boss around 30 times whether as bosses or just basic enemies. Hope you like fighting dragons too. First time you encounter one drop on top of you it is incredible and tense, once it happens to you 10 more times it stops being that way. These are not one offs. There are, I would reckon, around 10 bosses that are repeated more than 5 other times in the game and probably 50 other bosses more that are repeated at least once. You find out very quickly that most of the work on boss design went into the dozen or so core story bosses which, to be fair, are mostly great, Radahn and Malenia are phenomenal imo. There are some troll and gimmick bosses but every Souls game is allowed a couple. My main issue is just because of the size of the game, they feel obligated to overpopulate the land with bosses but without the time to properly flesh them out so they just end up being a reskin of another boss making it tedious. The sad thing is that it cheapens the really good boss fights and doesn’t let you set your expectations about whether the fight is going to be a memorable duel to the death or another snoozefest against a basic enemy you’ve fought 20 times before.

Lastly, I would be remised if I did not mention the Mountaintops of the Giants and the end-game difficulty spike, which is plainly ridiculous. I have probably close to 1,000 hours overall in every Dark Souls game including Demon’s Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro, and this is by far the craziest difficulty spike I’ve experienced. It’s like they combined Frigid Outskirts from Dark Souls 2 and Hunter’s Nightmare from Bloodborne and turned it up to 11. You have to constantly be on your guard at all moments. Pretty much any medium sized basic enemy from this point forward in the game can 1 or 2 shot you. The AI summon system, which up until this point felt like the true “Easy Mode” basically becomes a necessity. Bosses will 1 shot you with 70 vigor (close to the max health you can get). Enemies from the early game reappear with 5 times as much health and damage, while you’ve already reached your softcap in vigor and damage meaning there is no leveling around this problem now. It’s certainly doable, even without summons which is what I limited myself to during the bosses but god help new players who don’t have the experience or time to build in the reflexes.

In the end, I guess I could sum up my opinion on Elden Ring by saying it is simultaneously the easiest and hardest Dark Souls game and also ultimately, the best and worst Dark Souls game. This is simply due to the fact that it is so large and unwieldy that it is bound to have a lot of hits and misses. There are times in the game where you will think this is the greatest game ever made and other times where the level and enemy design is so bad you question whether or not it was even play-tested before release. Many of the problems I have with it, the rune economy, varying boss difficulty, over/under leveling, AI summons, copy pasting bosses, all evolve from the premise of the game being open world. So, while I agree with the fans that the open world is well crafted and probably one of the best a major game studio has developed, there are clear fundamental problems that need to be addressed with the “Open-world Dark Souls” formula if they are to continue down this path and make a sequel. If you still would like to experience it, I think it ultimately is worthwhile but something I personally will not be repeating for quite some time.";92.9;0.0;5.0;126.0;Posted: May 8

I have never enjoyed a Souls game before for a variety of reasons. I generally do not enjoy open-world games, as they tend to feel shallow and unrewarding. And yet, I greatly enjoy Elden Ring. I have like over 100 hours in it and haven't even finished the game yet (but I am getting close!), and have no intention of putting it down any time soon - it is the most well put-together open-world game I've ever played, and I think that they very successfully adapted the Souls core into an open-world format.

The combat is tough, but as an open world game you can always go explore and level or find a new build if you find yourself up against a wall. If things suck, hit da bricks. The world feels generally rewarding of exploration and filled with ways to tweak builds or upgrade items or have better/more heals, and you genuinely have the tools at your disposal to make the game easier. If you ever feel like you're throwing yourself at a wall, you probably are! You should go find a ladder or another way around it!

The game isn't perfect (no 21:9 or >60fps without launching the game 'offline' with anticheat disabled, some inputs are not rebindable on kb+m (e.g. map) which makes playing with my split keyboard impossible - which is fine, I wouldn't play a souls game without a controller anyways) to name a few minor complaints), but generally, the core game itself is almost perfect on its own. Most of the issues are just in how it's packaged up.";107.5;1.0;1.0;907.0;Posted: May 14

As someone who has been looking forward to this game for a really long time i can say that it easily exceeded the hype around it which nowadays is rare.the difficulty of this game varies by how you go about but ultimately how you play determines the difficulty which is very different from previous souls games which are linear and unless you beat a certain boss you cannot progress.";111.0;1.0;1.0;37.0;Posted: May 14

An incredible game overall with some of the best examples of why the Dark Souls games are so beloved by many. So many builds, so little time, with some balance patching needed regarding endgame imo, this truly has the potential to be From Software's best effort yet. Whether a returning Souls vet like myself, or a newcomer who's never touched an action RPG, you'll fall in-love with this world and the famous immersion and wonder that come with it!

While this game has arguably the best open world design since Witcher3 and Skyrim, the enemy boss design is mostly frustrating and the game suffers from greatly unbalanced enemies. Enemy types that combo almost indefinitely and hit like a truck are dominating the balanced enemies with hard hitting but slow attacks, where one actually sees fair openings inbetween.

A LOT has been great in this game and there is fun to be had. However ultimately, there are so many Quality of Life issues that make this game unnecessarily frustrating. That along with unfun enemies and a refreshing (one of the best groundworks, but just no finished thought) but also exploration-punishing quest systems that can't be maneuvered without relying on internet guides and frequently leads to acidentally missed or failed quests through seemingly completely unrelated actions on the other side of the map, doesn't let me recommend the game.

Obviously I had my money's worth from it and there is a great game in there but it is buried by frequent game design decisions that are just frustrating for frustrations sake.

Get the game if you like world exploration and design but for QoL and combat done right, visit Nioh2 (which conversely has a rather blend world/level design but one of the best thought through combat out there and nearly not a single game decision that could need a QoL overhaul)";123.1;0.0;2.0;133.0;Posted: May 12

I can understand the hype around this game now! While it's reputation of being a dark souls game scared me away at first, I decided to not listen to my fears any longer and gave the game a try, and...

I did not regret it.

This game is great as a stand alone single player experience as well as a game that you can co-op with friends or if you hate the strangers you see online, you can stomp them with pvp and duals! The world is vast and open (for the most part), there's a huge variety of enemies to practice your skillz on and there's a handful of NPCs that you can discover more of the world's lore through! Those same NPCs can even have an impact on what ending you can get. And if you don't care about the lore or the ending, it won't be in your face unless you go out of your way to look for it.
In the end, the beauty of this game is that no matter how you play it whether it's wandering and discovering things on your own or following a guide, you'll still get a lot of enjoyment and mileage out of a game with so much content!";173.4;1.0;1.0;15.0;Posted: May 12

Skyrim/WoW on steroids with buckets of atmosphere. I love this game! It's definitely more ideal to controller users, but you can make a working keyboard/mouse bind easy enough to the point it feels like a PC game and not a console port. I'm pretty much used to playing this with keyboard and mouse now, took a few hours to get used to it, but it's fine. My only advice is to just explore everything for yourself, avoid anything on Youtube so the game doesn't get ruined. Definitely the best game I've played in a long while.";42.7;1.0;1.0;231.0;Posted: May 12

This game was a first to me in the souls genre and i have to say it's amazingly hard for a brand new player. The controls are not hard to understand but the timings and little things are the trickiest.

This game is like wearing one of the most comfortable shoes in the world, but the shoe has a pebble stuck in it that you can't get out.

This is an incredible game, full of originality, heaps of content and replayability, tons of player agency and a really fun gameplay loop. However, it is plagued by nonsensical design decisions and bugs that impact my experience of the game every single time I play it.

Bugs like the cursor not staying locked to the game window, causing me to click on stuff on my second monitor and tabbing me out of the game and server issues causing frequent disconnects during coop, and design decisions like the incredibly long wait to quit out of the game and popups always automatically hovering on ""no"" instead of ""yes"", forcing me to move my mouse cursor, sometimes mid-combat, to select yes, severely impact my enjoyment of the game. Bringing the game from one of my favourites, to something I always find myself getting frustrated at while playing.";145.9;1.0;1.0;219.0;Posted: May 11

Games are rarely designed so well these days. Elden Ring is by no means perfect, but the overall experience of playing this is second to none. It also offers a lot to folks who enjoy their lore in games. Can't wait for the inevitable DLC.";190.0;1.0;1.0;206.0;Posted: May 11

Elden Ring so far is my Game of the year! I thought I was not going to beat it just for the fact that I am not one who thrives on challenging bosses and certain hoards of enemies. Luckily, friends help ease the pain. When I did beat the bosses, it felt super rewarding and satisfying. The graphics are great, the battle mechanics are pretty solid and I think the open world helps because you can do stuff in any order if you please. I also lost my runes quite often, mostly falling off cliffs and going through catacombs to retrieve my runes and failing in the processes. Once I beat a boss, I leveled up immediately. I will say that FromSoftware did a fantastic job. I definitely recommend Elden Ring to everyone! The only warning I have is you may experience emotional breakdowns because of how many times you will die.";118.2;1.0;1.0;28.0;Posted: May 10

It is a very good and for the most part fun but it has some major flaws, bosses will have very quick attacks that are hard to detect, some bosses have attacks that you can't do much about, there are many bugs and glitches still in the game, and bleed/magic builds are the meta with other builds being to weak or slow to be able to kill bosses efficiently.

I remember my boyfriend talking about this game when it first got announced and he explained how it is a souls-like game and therefore will be very difficult and I thought to myself that I would never buy it nor play it myself. Fast forward months later on the release, I bought it for my boyfriend and watched him play for a couple of hours and I found myself wanting to try it out. He then bought it for me and told me that he would be there to help me. I was genuinely so scared because I suck at video games and have never played any souls-like game and that I would probably just want to quit it after a couple of tries because of how bad I was. But now here I am with 70+ hours on it and enjoying every single bit of it until I beat it. This is the first game that I genuinely want to complete. With its beautiful open world, the combat, the enemies, music, and everything. It makes the game so complete and rewarding. I didn't realize how satisfying and amazing it felt to finally defeat a boss that has defeated me tens of times until I played this. This game made me step out of my comfort zone and let me to explore and find out a new type of game that I adore. The game gives you ample amount of resources to help you progress through the story but lets you figure it out on your own and it feels like an adventure every time you go out there. I am very excited to keep playing and beat it!! 100/10 recommended";71.6;1.0;1.0;42.0;Posted: May 10

After making a second character because I was unhappy with the build on the first one, I beat this game in 30 hours. Even though it didn't take me long, I loved almost every hour. There are some issues with performance and balance, both with weapons and enemies, but they are far outweighed by the good of this game.

To beat this game in 30 hours means I missed probably 75% of all of the world - it is huge and beautiful. Now on my third character, I am exploring more and having just as much if not more fun than I did with my last character. To someone who doesn't know what Souls games are, they might not like this game. It is difficult and unforgiving just like the previous games. If you like the previous games, this one takes all the strong elements of those and puts it in something so expansive that you might find something new in a playthrough years from now.";78.5;1.0;1.0;128.0;Posted: May 9

Brilliant Shooter Game

-Graphics: 9/10
The graphics are really good, even for 2022.
Visual effects are lifeless / pale but enough.

-Atmosphere: 8/10
The world of robots, in a green environment.
The atmosphere is shallow, not too deep.
""World of Titans""

-Gunplay/Melee Combat: 10/10
Damn it! gunplay is the main strength of Titan Fall 2. A great pattern for other fps games...
Control your robot, shooting at everything like a big villain...

-Customizations : 7/10
The customization part is not too bad, you can change your character,titans,weapons skin but it is not like Battlefield or CoD... you can customize your weapon loadout.
But many things are lacking and this is a big weakness!
Since I could not play the multiplayer part, I do not have enough information about it.

-Story: (8/10)x1.5
Jack Cooper is the Pilot protagonist and the playable character, beginning his military career as a Rifleman in the Frontier Militia.
He is the pilot of his best friend named BT-7274, indeed he is a robot but his emotions are like a human. you will have a great adventure with BT-7274.
In fact, I can not communicate with robots,that is, I can not accept robots as humans.
But at least it has a deeper story than other fps games like DOOM or Serious Sam!

Titanfall 2 is just fantastic. A campaign that is more than just an enjoyable adventure, it features constantly evolving mechanics always surprising you with new twists and exciting things to do. It brings a freshness I haven't seen since Portal 2, while keeping the length at ""just about right"".

There's genuine effort put into the plot and level design of what could have otherwise been a barebones story thrown in as a tutorial for the multiplayer mode. Instead, what little I heard of it made me check the game when I had no interest whatsoever in trying its multiplayer aspects. And I'm glad I got on this ride because it was such a fun romp!

While you can see most of the story outcomes (including the ending) come from a mile away, the moment to moment parts are crafted so well that it won't matter how predictable things are. Your character goes from low rank infantry trooper to an experienced mech pilot through the many gauntlets the story throw at you, and they are all glorious, memorable set pieces that vary the gameplay just enough, while introducing all sorts of charismatic villains to face off in such clashes.

And through all of that, the bond between the main character and the Titan's self-learning AI (nicknamed BT) grows slowly but noticeably and -- silly as it may seem -- that too becomes a highlight. From initially addressing the MC as a disposable ""Pilot"", to ""Cooper"", and eventually to first name basis ""Jack"", it's a scene with meaning and heart when BT suddenly turns to the MC and says ""trust me"" like an actual battle comrade would instead of just silently proceeding with the mission.

On to the gameplay, this too is a standout experience that differentiates Titanfall 2 from other shooters. With a fluidity and precision that are so seamless, you end up pulling whatever creative moves you can think of. Wall walking, double jumping, the stealth mode strafing, the absurd selection of weapons available to loot from the different militias (each weapon with its own distinctive feel), it all comes together to form a frantic parkour-infused action package that somehow manages to stay elegant at all times. And that's you playing as a soldier on the ground! The moment you embark on your humongous mech, the world changes, the tiny people in the ground trying to shoot are insignificant and only the brutal clashes against other Titans matter. It's satisfying how those two completely different realities coexist so well together.

All in all, a shame that the likelihood of a sequel of this quality is unlikely to ever appear.";7.7;1.0;11.0;2378.0;Posted: 11 May

I have played this game across multiple platforms and it is borderline unplayable on all of them. i repeat DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IN ITS CURRENT STATE. hopefully it will be fixed but that is very unlikely, unfortunately.";6.1;0.0;34.0;26.0;Posted: 12 May

One of the best FPS campaigns ever made. It somehow made me forget how much I hate mechs and even made me like them. Effect and Cause is also insanely good, definitely one of the best levels in video game history.

Loved this game at it's peak, but now, it's a shell, the servers are dead 90% if not 100% of the time, not dead as in no player base, but dead as in unplayable, yeah you can play the amazing single player campaign, but after that, there's nothing, since the majority of the game play in in Titanfall 1 took place online you'd expect to play a lot of Titanfall 2 online as well, but thanks to either the devs giving up and focusing Apex, or hackers, a lot of speculation for who killed the game. I don't recommend this game anymore it's not even worth the $4 USD they are asking for it, at this point they are snatching at any money they can make, but don't have hope for a third one with their shift towards battle royal, I will miss BT, and I will miss my minigun titan hot dropping and wiping the other team out.";35.8;0.0;6.0;126.0;Posted: 13 May

I am not a FPS fan, I dont play FPS games but when I do it has been Valorant recently. I would say Titanfall, but ever since the DDos of the servers the game is unplayable. It is very disheartening to see one of my favorite childhood games and franchises loose to a outside source. I love this game the series to death. If you are looking to purchase to play multiplayer good luck. The server will randomly crash but on other days they work. Its very shaky right now and sadly I think that is the best this game can do to recover. I dont have many hours on my steam profile. But I was easily gen 15 on my Xbox and played this game religiously when it came out (Thats about 300-500 hours for those who dont know). I love this game to death and I hope to see a sequel! Keep it up! Apex is a great game as well!";29.0;1.0;2.0;146.0;Posted: May 13

I, like many others, love this game to its core and would play it daily if the community was still alive, (and not full of hackers I'm sure) but woe is me for my first desktop has a wifi 6 enabled motherboard with an 11th generation Intel processor which means I cannot connect to the multiplayer servers due to a difference in security technology.

The single player campaign is gorgeous, but only 7 hours long, on my first run. Clearly intended to be driven by multi-player, like plenty of games since, which is a bit disappointing. Still, it was fun, and I typically hate jumping puzzle games.

I have hundreds of hours on this game on console. This game has set the standard for how fun an FPS game can be in both campaign and multiplayer. Every FPS I play will be compared to Titanfall 2.

Honestly great game, with wonderful visuals for a 2014 shooter and a mediocre story. However the gameplay is where it's at, I played this after Apex expecting an Apex campaign-like game, but holy cow, the movement, the guns, everything is just right. I said before the story is mediocre, but the setting is not, Apex had a great starting ground for a story because Titanfall 2 created the world.

Sadly, the game came riddled with bugs, and glitches and crashed constantly. I played the campaign first which took around 5 hours, hard mode, and it was amazing. I tried the multiplayer and was surprised when it could literally never work. I took a break, and tried to come back and play the campaign again, but the game would freeze-frame and never work.

Great Gameplay, good campaign, captivating world, but sadly riddled with technical errors not allowing constant playing.";7.0;1.0;1.0;25.0;Posted: May 10

If anyone was interested in purchasing this product, I have one piece of advice, keep the following number near your computer: 800-273-8255. That's the number for the suicide hotline, which you will be FREQUENTLY calling during your playing experiences. I cannot stress how inconceivably awful this game is. I should have known just by seeing EA plastered across the front of this trash. You will scream, probably go to the hospital for a fractured hand after you destroy your setup, and once you arrive back home, you'll just want to hang yourself from your ceiling fan... It's SO bad, that at one point, the game overtook my PC and destroyed my Discord in an attempt to not let anyone else know about the utter garbage I was dealing with. The funniest part is, 85% of the time, you just disconnect, which on ANY other game would be a bad thing, but I'm glad that I get a release from the demons that infect my thoughts for a brief moment while I contemplate the meaning of my sad, lonely existence.

Used to play this almost everyday back on PS4, now that I got it on PC i'm a bit disappointed. The Campaign somehow feels shorter than I remember (Maybe because I used to suck at the campaign, I breezed through the game on hard mode) and the multiplayer is quite literally unplayable, I used to just play Frontier Defense all the time on my PS4, but it seems that I cannot do the same on my PC, the Frontier Defense has terrible cue times, even worse than League of Legends on mobile! It's still a fun game but I wouldn't recommend buying it full price, do what I did and wait for a sale and buy it when the sale drops.";5.7;1.0;0.0;31.0;Posted: May 13

This game is the absolute best fast paced action shooter that you've always wanted. Move over Call of Duty and Battlefield, this is by far a better game. Like being able to operate heavy vehicles like in Battlefield? Well just wait till you suit up in a Titan. Love the intense action of Call of Duty? The mobility and gunplay of Titanfall has it beat. The movement system in Titanfall 2 is, and I'm not exaggerating here, the absolute best in any game, ever. I would say that Warframe is a close second. The single player is amazing as well! There is a part of the game (trying not to spoil much here...) where you gain a mechanic similar to Portal that is so so so so far ahead of it's time.

It's a shame that it doesn't have the support that it should from the parent company, but with the Northstar client you will be able to enjoy endless hours of gameplay.

Highly Highly recommend!";186.5;1.0;0.0;58.0;Posted: May 12

This game was a breath of fresh air for me. A somewhat modern game that is honestly an easy 10/10 for me which is so so so rare. I enjoyed every second of the campaign, literally. It was so well done. The multiplayer is decent and gives more longevity but I HIGHLY recommended this game for the campaign. You will feel so connected to your pilot and it really just is amazing. I haven't come across ANY glitches while going for 100% in the game and just. Wow. Good job Respawn team. I can't wait for Titanfall 3.";17.4;1.0;0.0;220.0;Posted: May 9

I heard people saying this game was good, so when it went on sale for like $3 I picked up and just played the campaign.
The campaign isn't long (about 6 hours) but it's really well made. Unlike the average FPS, this game has parkour mechanics and you get to pilot the robot named BT. The parkour sections are really fluid and well made, I had a lot of fun with them.
One part I really like is that while the tutorial teaches you how to play, it also tests your skill level, and then it recommended that I play on hard difficulty. If you know how to play an FPS game, hard is a good difficulty for you.
The story is a lot more interesting than I thought for such a short game. The 2 main characters, Cooper and BT, have entertaining dialogue with each other and it keeps the game fun. Even though he's a robot, BT feels like a real unique character, not just the boring robot stereotype.
If you see the game is on sale for $5 or less, it's worth it just to experience the campaign.

Another console game with absolutely terribly ported controls. Can't even get into it, dealing with annoyances every few seconds from the very beginning.

- Movement is bad - It is designed for a controller stick, not a keyboard. This means that your character will randomly start running a circle or running off to the middle of nowhere instead of going where you are pressing. The same applies to the horse. While riding with your group, he suddenly starts running a big curve away from everyone or backwards and then you have to fix it and catch up.
- Volume is quiet - This is a known bug, really had to boost all my volumes to hear dialogues. This is particularly annoying when the camera is far away as volume is also tied to distance from characters.
- Camera is bad - To get around tragic horse controls while trying to ride with someone, you can toggle cinematic camera by holding V, which causes the horse to follow the path on autorun (no other way to do it). You can then cycle through different angles/distances with C. The problem is, the game doesn't respect your choice. Even when you set it up just how you want it, within 5-10 seconds the game will switch to something else and you have to cycle through everything again to fix it. This means you miss half the conversations, because the camera suddenly zooms far away. The camera also can't be freely turned in this mode, so you end up missing all the scenery because it is aimed at the ground or some tree on the side instead of anything meaningful.
- Button holding - Every interaction needs a button hold, not a button press. There is no PC game that does this. There is no toggle for it. This makes everything you do painfully slow and super annoying.
- Animations are slow - Everything from walking to picking up items is like a grandpa doing it. In terms of looting chests, you need to hold the button per every single item you pick out and wait for the whole animation to play out. Needless to say, every chest will take you quite a while.
- Keybinds - The game uses half your keyboard for no real reason. Most games use either E or F consistently for every interaction. This one can't even decide whether looting alone is E or R because it uses both randomly so you have to constantly pay attention to the prompts, completely breaking any immersion.
- Saving - This is the first game I've ever seen that doesn't have the Save button in the main menu. It is buried in a submenu. Had to google to find out how to save. Not that it matters, because the game pretty much always stops you from saving manually anyway. Already annoyed by this as I tested the game when I got it and quit to continue the next day. Had to rewatch the whole intro and skip the 4-5 cutscenes manually one by one when they finished loading before I got back to where I was.
- Rockstar launcher - Great way to slow down loading of a 100+ GB game by another 30-40 seconds.

I haven't even gotten that far, but you can't go few seconds without being annoyed by all this. Almost feels like they never played a game before. In terms of Quality of Life features, this game has none.";2.0;0.0;5.0;242.0;Posted: 13 May

Beautiful, very alive world. Probably one of the best games ever made. Unfortunately, online is dead. It didn't make R🤮 enough shekels, so they completely stopped bothering with updates. Still fun with friends just because the world is so well-made and the physics are so good, but it gets boring eventually. If you haven't bought this game yet, I would suggest it, for the singleplayer if nothing else. If you're buying it for the online, wait for a sale.";69.1;1.0;1.0;123.0;Posted: May 13

So after 73 hours, I can easily say this is and will be one of my favorite all time games.
I got started with RDR2 pretty late after release. I started with RD online, because of a sale, and love the game, i just didn't like the lack of ways to make money online, and the total disregard of the RD online by the developers. But, I will say for RDR2 full story game version, is 100% worth the purchase if you haven't ever played it. Its one of the most stunningly realistic games I've ever played, The graphics of the game world are nuts, the NPC interaction, the horse riding, the hunting, the fishing, the bounty hunting, and everything in between is absolutely great. Its really hard to find any gripes about the game, other than the fact a skinning animation takes absurdly long with no option to skip. (this is a very minor nit pick) But, without that animation you kinda lose the immersion of hunting, killing, and skinning that animal.
Other than that, this game is a work of art really. You can tell they really put alot of effort and passion into this game at least for RDR2. (not online unfortunately)
All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for and Open World, Immersive, Story driven, pretty damn realistic, old western game. I don't think its possible to regret buying and playing this game the whole way through. Thanks for listening Steam community!";73.4;1.0;1.0;33.0;Posted: May 13
Red Dead Redemption 2;"Posted: May 13
In some ways this game is brilliant, but overall the gameplay had so many issues it felt like a slog by the end and I wish I could give this a ""depends"" rating. It's a great game if you have you a tolerance for spending a lot of time doing in game chores, watching slow animations, lacking player agency, and just OK combat. The story, graphics and immersion are some of the best I've seen.


Pros:
The story telling was amazing for the most part and the characters were memorable and well developed. Very few games sucked me in with the story as much as RDR2 and it kept me playing.
Arthur Morgan was one of the best protagonists in a game I've ever played, you really get attached to playing as him and it's great role playing
Some of the best graphics around, the world is just amazingly crafted
Great wild west music
Extremely immersive most of the time
Lots of character customization and side activities


Cons:
This game has some crashes and you can't save mid-mission so it restarts the entire thing even if you're 15 mins in. There are checkpoints but it won't remember them outside a crash. I lost progress a few times on a PC that never crashes on other games, and googling it reveals this crash is extremely common.






Anyway, I think whether you like this game or not really depends what you're in it for. It definitely wasn't a fast paced action game with impressive combat or tight controls, but its story telling, graphics, artistic direction and immersion cannot be denied.";44.5;0.0;1.0;216.0;Posted: May 13

this is the best game ever made, i think every single person with an interest in video games should play this. the first like 3 hours or so is a slow on-rails story/dialogue heavy prologue but once you're free to roam the open world, this is a transcendent experience. cons: this is the best looking game ever made, so you will need a good pc to run it. i played it at mid graphic settings on a 6core i5 and a 970 at like 30 fps and still had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blast and was constantly blown away by this game.

Edit: forgot to mention i have not touched the online mode at all. i hear its pretty much forgotten and bug/hacker ridden. the fact i have (at time of review) over 400 hours and still have only played single player tells you pretty much everything you need to know about this game.";414.2;1.0;2.0;91.0;Posted: May 8

One of, if not the best, Story Games out there. You absolutely must have played this.

But it also has it's flaws like outdated Game Design and getting pretty clunky here and there. This didn't mess a whole lot with my enjoyment though, because i got used to it pretty quick to it even with a controller in 2018 on a PS4 Pro.

Mission Design is sometimes too linear and doesn't let you deviate enough from the path. In free roam with side storys and random encounters it isn't much of a problem though. I still wished they would let you experiment more with your own playstyle.

Online Mode is a thing that i don't really want to rate here since it's basically a whole bunch of horse poopoo and this review would instantly be negative.

Do yourself a favor and just play the story. If you really want to play online make sure you have a friend or two to mess around with, otherwise it won't be fun. You will witness a lot of cheaters, trash monetization and very boring gameplay loops with no rewards to them cause they want your MONEH.

Maybe Dutch did develop Red Dead Online after all.";4.6;1.0;1.0;181.0;Posted: May 11

Very good game! The missions seem so fluid and just like real life! It isn't like starting a contract from scratch. The sound design is truly perfect! It greatly helps to feel really immersed. While I was reading the newspaper in the street, people were walking by, sound of blacksmth, people talking, etc. And the voice acting is super too. The initial camp also felt a lot like the Hateful Eight's vibes, with Arthur in the blue coat, just like Samuel L Jackson in the movie! Really, I am loving this game so far and from what I have been told and the story which is gonna get better chapter by chapter, I think this game is gonna be at the same level of the Witcher games for me!";15.7;1.0;2.0;54.0;Posted: May 11

Online Cash Grab Rockstar does not update this amazing game anymore; what a shame. Plus out sourced the online portion to take 2 which is a complete and obvious cash grab company. Single player is amazing though but they never updated it and never used the content they put into the game. I would recommend if they actually gave a crap about their game. They should make two takes before they give take 2 the online portion. Singleplayer is still good enough to be recommended alone.";10.1;1.0;0.0;58.0;Posted: May 8

Yeah, story is pretty good. Haven't touch much of online. Maybe like 4 hours total. Rest is story. Modding is slowly coming out but be careful with timing/ interactions.

Hello from an avid Red Dead Redemption fan,
This game is absolutely stunning, for anyone wanting an amazing single-player experience, this is the game. As fun as online is, it gets stale fast, I am level 110 and it's still fun if you know where to look. But, as many have already heard, Rockstar neglects this masterpiece to appeal to their shareholders keeping GTA V alive. If they gave even 20% of their current attention on GTA V to RDRO then this game would be absolutely perfect. It feels sometimes that the game developers at Rockstar are just being held hostage. GTA V needs to die and move on to bigger and better things. That being said I would recommend RDR and RDRO for the ultimate western experience. Unfortunately only for a short time.
Thanks,
Jake";263.7;1.0;1.0;101.0;Posted: May 11

just what a masterpiece should look like. normally games get loose progressing towards the end due to endless side quests, lame storylines etc. This is the first game I actually check my progress and feels sad that the progress % continous to increase towards the end";94.9;1.0;1.0;179.0;Posted: May 7

Ok the previous review was just a joke between me and one of my friends:)) now lets get to real one.

RDR2 is surely one of the most entertaining games (just like other R* games) but with a lot of problems especially on pc
pc port of RDR2 is still ♥♥♥♥♥. I played it with ryzen 5 and rtx3060 and frame rate was horrible in cities. Despite that, there is problem with people and animals hair is so blurry and you can literally count pixels!! It's so annoying and seems like this problem was in game since launch. I played RDR2 back in 2018 on XBOX One and i didn't had this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ problem. Its pc exclusive!
Well we pass the technical problems we have gameplay and design issues. RDR2 World as everybody now is the most realistic world in all games and in the world and sidequests, game really is the best, but when you get in to main missions, disaster begins. Game literally dont allow you do any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. Basics of the gameplay are incredible. Gunplay feels great, clothing and character movements are very beautiful and realistic, but problem in this department is that it doesn't have any progress and improvements. In the middle of the game you almost take what do you need in missions and thats that. You have to play something like 100 hours with same stuff and do things that get frustrating after hours.
And the story isnt perfect either. There are some plotholes and the way game tells the story is suck. Especially in second half of the game.
We have All of this problems in gta v too and probably we are gonna see them in gta vi and RDR3. Its the way Rockstar get attention of casual gamers. RDR2 is a good game and you will have good time playing it, but it dosent worth to buy. Play the cracked version.";21.8;0.0;1.0;37.0;Posted: May 9

3 Hours trying to get this POS working in windows on an 11900K/3080/64GB RAM at 1080/60 with everything on low/off. Can't push a reliable 60fps (gets 35-55 fps) during the benchmarks. New drivers, all updates, every optimization I can find online.

Meanwhile, it runs amazingly in Linux, locked 60fps+ with everything on ultra, but crashes randomly so I can't finish the first mission, which is a half hour long with no save points for some reason.

Rockstar couldn't develop their way out of a wet paper bag.";3.6;0.0;2.0;546.0;Posted: May 12

-Finished downloading the game.
-Excitedly booted it up.
-Tweaked settings to see which I would prefer.
-Run test benchmarks thrice and on the 3rd time is the 1st instance of infinite loading after ending benchmark.
-Final tweaking of settings with a bit of frustration on how a simple misclick could reset the unsaved changes and have to redo it all over again.
-Finally done with the tweaking and started story
-Waited, waited and waited never got past the loading screen of gun barrel spinning
-Checked google and youtube for help and issue still persist. Installed this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on my SSD 970 evo plus 500gb hoping it would load faster, I guess not.
-Tried my own fix on the game settings as well with multiple game restarts and still nothing but stuck on the loading screen.
-Frustrated due to the fact that its unplayable on my brand new (all parts) 3 month old (approx) rig.

Disappointed with this ♥♥♥♥. All I wanted to do is just test it out for a few before I go to sleep to work later. I'm glad I tested this out so I could refund it as early as now. I was really excited to play this slow paced story rich game. I had 1.2 hours of game time in which mostly is just tweaking the settings and waiting for nothing being stuck on the loading screen after pressing Story. 10/10 recommended for refund.

This may not happen to everyone but if it works on yours then good, if not then refund immediately you're better off spending it for another game that actually lets you play.";1.3;0.0;2.0;27.0;Posted: May 12

Criminally underdeveloped where it matters most, even as it sports polished flair when it comes to visuals and miscellaneous details. Most fun to be had is in playing as a highway man in the open world, robbing people as they pass by, waiting for trains to board and marauder, shooting indiscriminately. Sadly, there are no improvements to this side of it from the first installment.

In many ways, it has become worse.

The AI feels more predictable and acts unreasonably, as they almost always either pull out a gun the moment you have one already pointed at them, or they go through a list of predetermined lines and give you pennies. There is nothing that separates them from one another.

Do not expect a single reward for doing anything outside the story. One of the main frustrations you are bound to have is this: there are no reliable ways to make money. No side activities are worthwhile doing. You are not allowed to rob banks, take over towns, explode buildings or derail trains. The little you are able to do pays very little and becomes repetitive right from the get-go. The bounties are terrible, the hunting and fishing dull, the purchasing and selling tedious and immaterial. Almost all the money you are going to get comes to you as a reward for completing two specific missions, one of them being the last of the epilogue. On your own, you have no hope of raising nearly as many dollars as you are just unceremoniously handed.

The story takes precedence over anything else, as you will frequently find yourself unable to visit certain locations because of plot-related reasons, with what amounts to a brick wall preventing any exploration deemed inconvenient. The kinds of activities you would expect to be able to do are all locked away behind side and main missions, not to be accessible ever again once done.

The shoot-outs appear at first to be the saving grace; unfortunately, once you have been through two or three, you have been through them all. The wanted system is poorly done, with lawmen spawning a few meters off-screen endlessly in waves, no matter how many you put down. Once you figure out the aiming and shooting, exterminating group after group of the same type of enemy becomes cheap drudgery.

All the sightseeing in the world cannot make up for such a shallow open-world experience. Painstakingly directed missions, oceans of dialogue and insane amounts of visual refinement only prove what wasted effort went into this title, which could have truly been revolutionary, had the developers had the same amount of respect and care for the gameplay loop, as they did for the ornamental impression-making details.";105.0;0.0;4.0;347.0;Posted: May 12

requires a rockstar online social club membership to play single player offline.

there appears to be no way around this membership, you cant just tell steam to play offline and play the game you legally bought.

also.. the social club authorisation you MUST have to play the game simply does not work. even if you are logged into your rockstar account, and have linked steam to it.. it just rejects your game as an unauthorised log in no matter what.

It has never worked once for me despite dozens of attempts to get them to recognise the game I paid AAA prices for.

steam refuses refund as allegedly not working is not a breach of consumer law.

Tried everything from disabling firewall, reinstalling this huge game, renaming the document folder, etc. Nothing works.

The game is a solid 10/10 if you can launch it, and play it without any error. Unfortunately, not for me and my laptop. Lesson learned, I will avoid every rockstar game on PC from now on coz of the BS launcher. Refunded it.";0.7;0.0;1.0;13.0;Posted: May 9

Buy it for the Story mode but.....

Red Dead Online is made to just make you spend more money on an already expensive game.

Forces you to use Rockstar Launcher
and even the offline Story Mode requires that you are online while playing..
Meanwhile the game has already been cracked, and the crack works offline. So, the people who pay for the game get a worse experience than the people who don't have to.


Edit: Apparently you CAN play the Story Mode offline without internet. But still my point still stands, the people with the cracked version do not have to put up with the Rockstar launcher. And others have reported problems with playing Story Mode when Rockstar Servers were down.";4.3;0.0;0.0;144.0;Posted: May 14

I had this game on my wishlist since it launched, and finally bought it when it went on sale. I was hoping it would be like Skyrim with an old-west setting and weapons. Like Skyrim, it starts off with a long cut-scene, but where Skyrim basically sets you 'free' afterward, RDR2 keeps you locked into a story for who knows how long (I quit after an hour and got a refund).

- I found the UI very awkward for use on a PC. It is clearly designed for a console.
- Very difficult to target and interact with objects.
- Motion on foot or on horseback is slow to respond, and gets really messed up if you try to engage in dialogue while moving (as is expected during the initial ride in the blizzard).
- Switching between 1st and 3rd person view is awkward. Mouse-wheel zooming to do this is somewhat of an industry standard - but not in this game.

I imagine most if the great reviews are coming from console players who are used to this kind of UI. I play exclusively on a PC and expect better.";0.9;0.0;1.0;51.0;Posted: May 7

Content warning: Gratuitous Graphic Suicide

I really enjoyed this game so far and would recommend it far and wide - it is gorgeous, it has an interesting story, the attention to detail is truly impressive. I spent fifty hours just getting lost in the countryside, rustling farmers' cattle and getting beaten up by trigger-happy law-enforcement over random bumpkins walking into me - and I have not even completed Act 2 (of 6?) yet.

Unfortunately, the side mission We Loved Once and True III also just made me watch a young boy shoot himself in the head ten times in a row for, well, really no compelling reason whatsoever. Basically it's just long horse race and then a variation on a standoff. And the reward for finally beating that particularly poorly-designed task was watching Arthur give the guy a clap on the back, a ""there there"" and then hand him the gun back.

Don't know if something better comes after that, that was enough of a hard no for me to make me quit and uninstall. You do not get to place this kind of content in my life if this is how you are dealing with it.";59.6;0.0;1.0;164.0;Posted: May 12

When they said they were going to port Dwarf Fortress to STEAM. I thought the meant the whole game not the ten million and confusing key bindings. My


Rockstar kicked in the doors over at Bay 12 games, beat up Toady and stole the largest chunk of software they could, which was the software code for the confusing menus and controls. There four separate menus that are similar but slightly different and activated by different controls. They key binding are not logical and confusing. I haven’t seen such a bad design for the controls. I guessing they built a game, released it, and then Oh we should have added a way for the players to actually play the game, like imputes of some sort. However they set the default controls interactions of all NPC to mirror the social interactions of ROCKSTAR cooperate office, meaning you great everybody by punching them in the face and then choke holding them. No option for a friendly wave or a general greeting. It straight to the ultra-violence and not even a decent milk bar.

In the short hours I played it I got to watch all sorts of game breaking cheats by players. Such as players flying the sky and raining down dynamite on players faster than the US in a country with oil. Or roping you from the next hill way over the distance. Even the horses break the game. The been several times I had to tell my posse to come punch me off my horse, because I was stuck again. I also noted that dynamite will get you off a glitched horse. I think the worst abuse we had was another. Player would teleport to a player, drop dynamite, teleport away and repeat until the abused player left the game. I myself got caught up in a mission where a hostile player could force me to exit wagons while he was at a distance so far I could even hit him with a rifle shot. Fortunately, the player doing the teleport, drop dynamite, teleport away killed him and caused my game to glitch out and boot me from that server.

One of the aspects I hate about the games is the slow and painful grind of the level system. OR how your progress gets stopped because of the leveling system. Some of it makes no sense. Most games containing fishing, you can fish from the get go. Even in the real world you hand a fishing pole to a level zero character, or the real-world equivalence of a five-year-old. In this game it absolutely mandatory you commit genocide and make species go extinct in a murderous psychopath rage for several hours before you allowed to have a fishing pole. Then in a full circle, the controls for fishing are awful and complicated for no apparent reason. The painful grind is to force a person to pay more money for a game they already purchased, so that it can be enjoyable again. To unlock certain “paid content” expext to pay real cash for things contained in a game you already paid money for.

The game is playable, by the players who cheat, the complex controls and the slow leveling system nearly make it unplayable.";26.9;0.0;0.0;238.0;Posted: May 14

Probably a good game if you haven't played the first, but compared to the first, it's a massive disappointment. It feels like a DLC rather than a sequel, and even as a DLC it would've been meh at best. They managed to sort out the pop-in issues for the most part, but other than that, they stripped out everything I loved, and was looking forward to more of, from the first game.

I'm hoping for a sequel, and want more from these devs, but it has to be a thumbs down as I really hope they go back to the cyclops and the focus on the dark, scary depths of the first. No more above land stuff, please!";21.2;0.0;21.0;115.0;Posted: 13 May

Below Zero takes everything that was captivating and amazing about Subnautica and blatantly disregards it in an attempt to break new ground with a new story.

Every individual component of the game is executed worse than the previous iteration.

The story is the least disappointing part, except for the part where you've already figured out everything about halfway through. There are no surprises, no twists, no turns. Character vignettes are surprisingly well done, and they did a good job making the unseen cast have their presence felt. The decision to voice the protagonist and give them their own spoken narrative... obliterates the storytelling whenever she speaks up. She's not very relatable, and her dialogue is mediocre most of the time. The VA performance is great, from her and the rest of the cast. But it never stops being jarring every time she speaks, and really breaks the feeling of isolation and tension. I want to feel like I'm uncovering something spooky and mysterious, and it's impossible to do that if every time I find something notable, the main character pipes up to give commentary that often doesn't fit the mood of the player at the moment.

Locations are a nightmare. The world map is broken up in such a way that you find yourself doing mostly ""dead-end"" journeys. You venture out to an area, and have to go further and further into it until you find what you were looking for, and then retrace your steps methodically to leave. There are few interconnections, most locations only have one way in or out, with tons of dead space between their entrances and where you need to go. You will constantly be backtracking your way out of the same places you've been. Cave networks are more convoluted and devoid of landmarks that make navigation palatable. You can expect to run in circles wondering if you've actually explored the breadth of an area, because the one branch looks identical to the next.

Creatures are mostly underwhelming. Most of the ""enemies"" can be safely disregarded, and apart from a few areas, don't guard or patrol anywhere remarkable. The predator creatures are often copy-pasted to ridiculous extents in otherwise empty waters, but can still be avoided simply by going around them.

Land exploration is like pulling teeth. Journeying through blinding snow is exhausting, as every location looks and feels the same. Land areas are open and repetitive, with few interesting landmarks or terrain to make them unique. You unlock a hoverbike to help you navigate the terrain, but then they make much of the terrain in those areas poorly navigable on the bike. At no point do you have an opportunity to open up the throttle and speed across the glaciers, really making use of the mobility.

Vehicles are worse than before. Cooler concepts, but after 16 hours I hadn't found enough researched parts to really build out any of the offerings. An upgrade here, an upgrade there. Never really felt like I got to use them beyond just taxi service. The Prawn is completely unused in the game apart from those players who may want to build megabases for fun.

Overall, if you've played the first one, you can safely leave this aside.";16.7;0.0;11.0;308.0;Posted: 14 May

Huge disappointment after Subnautica.

The story: feels forced and unnatural, and there is no coherent storyline to the actions you have to take to progress through the game. Furthermore, it's very short and there is no satisfying ending. To make matters worse, the game gives you sometimes little to no guidance on where to progress further, it just tries to inflate the otherwise short playtime by forcing you to wander around - on one occasion I had to look up a location online, otherwise I would have literally got stuck at that point.

The map: is too small and uninteresting, and the different biomes are not distinctive enough which makes navigating unnecessarily difficult. This is especially true for the biomes above water, where everything just looks the same. The map size does not even necessitate building a base for the sake of it being more central, which in Subnautica was a lengthy and worthwhile undertaking. Such a shame that they put so much effort into the base assets (much more and nicer than in the original) that you are not required to use.

The animals: do not even come close to the original game. Nothing beats Reaper Leviathans. The scary animals in this game are just not scary, though the penguins are nice.

The tech: feels rehashed and repetitive. Compared with the great vehicles of Subnautica, these feel very badly designed for exploration and are not good at what they do. I miss the Cyclops. The Seatruck is just an absolute oaf, difficult to pilot in tight spaces and you can barely see out of the cockpit, which makes navigating super difficult.";60.1;0.0;18.0;58.0;Posted: 11 May

I was excited to play this game because I loved the original Subnautica. When I saw it was discounted, I immediately bought it and started playing. I had tons of fun for the first hour and a half, running around collecting materials, finding out some of the story, and even constructing the seatruck. But then I encountered an issue that completely ruined this experience for me. I went to the Delta Base beacon and everything was completely unloaded and I phased right through the ground. I thought, ok thats annoying but I can just reload the game and hopefully it will be there. I then attempted to save the game and then quit, but I was stuck on the saving screen for more than 20 minutes. I finally had to force quit the game to get out of the save bug and I logged back in to see that all of my progress is gone. This is supposed to be a complete game and has been out for over a year now. These kinds of game breaking issues should not still be in the game. Having this happen to me completely ruined the experience for me and I immediately uninstalled the game. Maybe I will pick it up again in a couple months and play it, but how am I supposed to know this won't happen again?";1.6;0.0;9.0;61.0;Posted: May 13

An amazing continuation of the first game. As always, the biomes are absolutely magical and jaw-dropping.
SPOILERS BELOW
-The tracker tool is an amazing addition, really helpful
-The customizable sea truck is a game changer, way less bulky and cumbersome to maneuver than the cyclops, albeit less spacious
-The addition of the temperature makes land exploration more challenging, which I personally enjoyed
-A lot more story based than the first, but still a lot to explore freely

There are some downsides:
-The snowfox is a bit of a headache to drive, not sure if it's meant to be so sensitive
-The tether tool seems kinda pointless, only one direction and it only works with the original teleporter module, so you can't have multiple teleporter locations. If you teleport away from your prawn suit or sea truck, there's no easy getting back to them";37.0;1.0;1.0;16.0;Posted: May 14

I have to rate this game negatively in hopes the devs make another because I would like to see changes.

Basically, Subnautica was/is a complete masterpiece. Absolutely terrifying and wonderful. At the end I just wanted more; bigger levels, more leviathans, more cyclops.

Below Zero does not provide this and the game is weaker for it. I wish the devs had spent less time world building and more time building environment size, leviathan size, and sea truck size. Hopefully there is another game and it goes back to the feeling of the original game";44.0;0.0;3.0;110.0;Posted: May 14

This game misses the point of the original Subnautica. What really made the original Subnautica so incredible was the world. It was mysterious, scary and dangerous. You were thrown into it without a clue of where to go, surrounded by monsters far bigger than you, whom could swim way faster than you. The waters were deep, seeing the floor of the ocean from the surface was almost always an unlikely thing - everything felt more visceral compared to Below Zero

Below Zero strangely feels as though it's the first game in the series, and the original Subnautica is the sequel, it's simply ""less"" of a game compared to the original. Every aspect BZ tries to improve on is something no one asked for, or makes the game less endearing.

The world is shallower, literally. It isn't nearly as deep, not that this is typically an issue, but that sense of depth is less refined here, you feel 'safer' which in this game, is actually a bad thing.

The vehicles are less interesting, the 'sea truck' is fine, but it doesn't live up to the first games selection of unique vehicles. The cyclops was amazing, it was huge and impressive, could hold your smaller vehicle and it felt like a moving base. Below zero is a worse game without it.

Perhaps the biggest issue with Below Zero is the narrative. I'm not even here to discuss the quality of the story, I just think this kind of game is worse as a result of having a main character that speaks and there being people (person) out in the open world. The sense of total isolation and mystery is gone as a result of a more personable story line and it brings context to situations that would have been better off with the players left wondering. Lots of unnecessary personification.

I do think our main character is incredibly hard to relate to as well. We know she's a zoologist, we know she hates the corporation Altera, we know she loves her sister, but she's already established before the game starts, and she doesn't really have enough going on, at all, for me to care about her in this story. At most she is a nuisance, at the worst, she actually totally draws you away from the atmosphere and sense of isolation you should be feeling in this game.

Overall, there are dozens of small things that make this game feel worse than it's predecessor, I'd simply suggest buying the first game.";5.5;0.0;2.0;244.0;Posted: May 8

If you have not seen ANYTHING about it, play it, but if u have seen jacksepticeye or markiplier play it before the major update you will rather dislike the game. They made it worse to say. Karen/Susan (PDA girl) was changed to an indian sounding person (?why tho?). And the original plot got changed ALOT.";25.0;1.0;2.0;26.0;Posted: May 14

- Just play the original Subnautica. Play this only if you're desperate for more Subnautica world to explore. -
I love love love the first Subnautica game, but this one feels like it moved in a wrong lateral direction.
NEW LAND AREA: There's more to do on land and it's fun to drive the snowmobile vehicle around and the snow worms are cool, but that wasn't what i wanted from a Subnautica game. The land section meshes terribly with the ocean activities and objectives. The game feels wider instead of deeper, and more shallow as a result.
STORY: Margarite and AL-AN never interact in the plot despite being the two (living) main non-player characters as far as I know. The separate story threads are decent, but they all mesh TERRIBLY. The Margarite plot seems to have very little impact on the story. I was not all that attached to AL-AN by the end of the game, because he rly isn't that helpful and the alien artifacts don't feel like they reveal any new interesting lore unlike the first game alien facilities reveals.
FINAL THOUGHTS: I miss the big submarine you put one of your smaller vehicles in, and the sea truck is like that but does not feel nearly as good. I like the new creatures, but wish there were some even bigger scarier ones in there, or that more of the creatures could be tamed or utilized in newer interesting ways like the Sea Monkeys. The sunken crashed ship exploration, while a decent change of pace for places to explore, feels tacked on from the last game to give the laser cutter a reason to exist. All the basic stuff from the first game is there, so again, if you liked Subnautica 1, you'll like this Subnautica: BZ. But i just could not recommend this game to someone. While I highly recommend you the original Subnautica, you yourself have to want to play MORE Subnautica to play Subnautica: BZ.

MY RE-DESIGN THOUGHTS (Additions not in the original or this game, but i think would've made for a better sequel.) : IMO the game should start on land, and you have to work your way to the deep ocean floor caves, or the reverse of starting near the ocean floor and having to work your way up to the surface. Bouncing between the two feels like a waste of the new main feature of the NEW big open land area. ORRR, throw out the land area altogether, and just make an even more terrifyingly deep ocean. And as for vehicles, I wish there was an even bigger submarine to park my submarine in, like straight up Disney's Atlantis up in there. And then a creature even bigger than THAT submarine. And as for the story, make AL-AN the cause of SOMETHING besides the lore for why the MC's sister is on the planet, or interact with Margarite. Also, Margarite has such a big splash at the start of the story only to do almost nothing the rest of the game. Maybe there's a twist where AL-AN turns on the player and Margarite has to intervene, just SOMETHING. The first half of the plot is so much, and the back half of the plot is so basic like, ""Yep, nothing has changed, thanks for doing all the collecting and exploring, here's the end cutscene.""";53.2;0.0;2.0;371.0;Posted: May 7

TL;DR: Buy on sale, totally worth it then.

When I read this game was almost like an expansion pack rather than a separate game, it made me wary of buying it. Bought it on sale and found this statement to feel way too accurate. Initial gameplay had me thinking this game might be a different experience BUT, the game is extremely similar in most ways. It overall FEELS LESS enthralling and fulfilling.

The Biomes LOOK full but feel desolate as hell most of the time. Two or three of them seem to have no gatherable flora/fauna at all, even just non-edible items for the bioreactor.

IDK if the map was larger than the old one, but it felt like the same amount of overall resources were spread out more. Felt like I was travelling more for less as well. Maybe the OP from the first game spoiled me a bit too much.

Found myself looking for a few mid tier items after spending a copious amount of time exploring and building for lols and never encountering the mentioned item; all while gathering plenty of all other materials. I would think and would be some of the last things I fill a box up with...";21.9;1.0;0.0;97.0;Posted: May 14

Generally feels a bit less coherent than the original.
It spreads itself thin, there's a larger focus on terrestrial exploration, which pulls you away from the main gameplay loop of going deeper and deeper. It feels like a jarring cutaway from the thing you play the game for.

Additionally, the linear story draws away from one of my favorite parts of the first game. No longer are you exploring out of an intrinsic curiosity, but rather, a linear series of events is pushing you forward constantly.
The first game had things to push you forward, but there were several points at which you were left to your own devices.
It takes the choice away from you, and makes exploring on your own feel like a deviation from the norm, rather than a necessity, which takes the cool factor out of stumbling upon new areas away to some extent.

Overall still highly recommend, but if you're fine with sacrificing the quality of life changes, the first game is a better purchase.";36.2;1.0;0.0;61.0;Posted: May 14

If you're expecting something exactly like Subnautica then you'll be disappointed. Below Zero is a lot more linear and narrative driven, but still a very good game. You're no longer a mute protagonist (in fact you actually have a lot to say), you're never ""alone"", and that's all I can really say without spoiling anything. There's still beautiful environments, goofy fish, base building, etc.

Also, the Seamoth and Cyclops have been merged into one vehicle: the Sea Truck. You'll build the cabin early on, then obtain ""trailers"" to hitch to the back as you progress. It's not better than the two, but it's not worse. It's a whole new experience, which I personally enjoyed. You won't feel invincible like in a Cyclops. In fact, you will normally feel extremely vulnerable, but the amount of customization the Sea Truck has puts the Cyclops to shame.";37.1;1.0;0.0;119.0;Posted: May 14

Fun game - very close experience to the first game. Similar progression, exploration, crafting. Feels like a lot less requirement to farm materials. New creatures, land exploration, and story all keep this game feeling fresh. The story builds on the first game and gives a nice alternate perspective.

I do miss the submarine. The seatruck is cool, but I honestly never ran it with any segments other than the prawn suit docking station. Never even built the land vehicle because it didn't seem necessary. The prawn suit works just fine and is quite nimble on land with the grappling hook.

Guidance for where to explore and find things is a little whack. I got both advanced oxygen tank recipes before I ever found the mid-tier oxygen tank. And got super lost towards the end when I stopped getting beacons from the game. The Wiki helped solve both of those issues, but it would be nice if the game was able to provide you with the information to progress, or give you some way to work for the info.";21.2;1.0;0.0;310.0;Posted: May 10

Now back to this game, after being launched, logically we were ready to play this game in 6 hours after it launched, i think it was a friday morning and we had no plans. To sum up - the best weekend ever. We finished the game in 2 days and looking back the binge was definitely not worth it, i kind of ruined it. Yes there are some cons too, but anyhow I just can't really put into words how the game felt.

The world and design is a great improvement on the original visually.

If you're looking for a fantastic two person co-op experience then look no further.
Grab a friend and get really angry at eachother for not being able to explain the basics of a door and weird symbols!
The story is an incredible step up from the previous games (which are also out right fantastic) and the puzzles are challenging and really interesting.
At the time of my review there are a few bugs like framerate stuttering and a puzzle or two that gets you just stuck, but the game is good at leaving checkpoints so getting back to the same spot will be no issue at all.

I whole heartedly recommend this game, even at full price this game is a steal!";10.7;1.0;22.0;1613.0;Posted: 11 May

We Were Here Forever is easily the best game in the series. every puzzle was interesting and challenging, and the difficulty would only increase each chapter.

my only complaint would be the bugs and slight performance issues. considering it took quite a while to make this game, i do believe it should've been polished a bit more upon release. a bit frustrating that i unlocked both achievements for both endings at the end, and my save bugged out, meaning i had to restart the finale/chapter. as mentioned before with performance issues, i experienced frame drops that would make me restart my game every once in a while. (20-40 fps, even with ideal settings.)

other then the bugs, i would rate We Were Here Forever a 9.5/10, and would recommend playing We Were Here Together first if you've never played any of the games in the series. We Were Here is a fantastic series if you are into puzzle games or even just looking for something different to play with a friend.";16.3;1.0;8.0;54.0;Posted: 13 May

Written Review
We were here forever is a great new addition to the fantastic co-op series.


The games are asymmetrical co-op games, that have you work together over walkie-talkies in order to solve puzzles. You are rarely in the same room, and get glimpses of lore as you explore atmospheric castle set pieces.


You get exactly what you'd expect here. Forever is more of the same, but not in a stale way. Some puzzle styles will feel familiar, while others bring fun and fresh ideas to the table. It's a great mix.

A lot of the time, you will be visiting unique looking areas that are in strong contrast to the drab bricked dungeons we're used to in the series. And we get a lot more story and cutscenes in this game, for those itching to learn more about the world. It's done well, and doesn't feel like it gets in the way of pacing.

The graphics are charming, and the music always enhances the mood. I got sucked into the environment, and got spooked or fascinated many times.

For the most part, the puzzles are pretty tough, but you will figure them out with perseverance. However, like in past games, there are a few puzzles that really had us scratching our heads for a long time. The game can get quite tough at times, with some time-sensitive puzzles, or others that have you juggle a ton of information in your head at once.


In the end, if you enjoyed the series up to this point, I think you will have fun with this game too. I think the games have been growing in terms of quality and length with every new installment. And if you haven't played the series yet, and enjoy asymmetrical co-op games, (and don't mind possibly losing your friends over puzzle misunderstandings), then give the series a try!";20.0;1.0;88.0;4079.0;Posted: 10 May

Don't take this review without reading this.
The game is fun with lots of good ridles but we had over 3 hours of gameplay needed to restart some chapters due to bugs, a save buged out (Black screen for the host) and multiple items without pickup possibility (pickaxe or pipe).
I can recommend this game easly but wait up some bugfixes if you don't want to waste time on reseting the game";11.0;0.0;29.0;200.0;Posted: 14 May

After my first play through I would rate this a 9.5/10
The game play is truly remarkable! From the puzzles of varying difficulty and length, to the atmospheres that help immerse me into the game, each chapter that was played allowed me to enjoy the game more and more but also helped get the proverbial gears turning in my head for further puzzles.

The music alone is really nice and I would love to see a soundtrack available for download! :)

All together, We Were Here Forever stands to this date my favorite puzzle game and I am excited to go through it again!


The only issues I have had so far are sometimes the walkie-talkies would stop working for an entire chapter (restarting would fix) and in the last portion of the game, there is a animation to get up ladders which was kinda buggy but other than those two small bugs, smooth sailing.";12.2;1.0;6.0;137.0;Posted: May 12

fantastic game, absolutely loved playing it with my best friend who i played all the other we were here games with, there were some issues, like some frame drops and like 2 different game breaks that were resolved instantly by reloading the game

one issue, as far as i can see theres almost no way to tell which person is playing what role, which got aggravating because when we came back to the game the next day, we had no idea which person was which character, which in the end doesn't really matter but we thought it would and caused a bit of distress";8.8;1.0;4.0;100.0;Posted: May 12
We Were Here Forever;"Posted: May 11
I've played all the previous games in the series and this one seems to be the most broken of them all. At first I couldn't start it at all, the game froze when loading data from the server.
Then my journey with a friend began, we went through the first 2 chapters and ended up at a crossroads in the middle of the city. The biggest mistake was that we went to the right into the underwater world. It turned out to be the 5th chapter right away, and everything would be fine if there were no bugs in the game that lead to a black screen that remains even after a restart and you can’t play further. The only fix is to launch the checkpoint from the menu (bypassing the save), but in this way the progress of the game is reset, because we accidentally skipped the 3rd and 4th chapters and started the fifth one right away (at least hang a sign). Now every time the game crashed, we had to replay half of the game to reassemble the damn telescope.
Question to the developers - why did you make it possible to select chapters out of turn, if this leads to broken saves and the need to go through the same thing 3 times?
Thumbs down for optimization - when loading a location, even on a high-end PC, the fps drops to 10-15. Wow
This is a good cooperative puzzle (which is rare), but the impression of the game was bad.
The funniest thing is that in the finale, instead of a dramatic ending, I laughed because my friend levitated in the air while I was sitting on the raft.";14.9;0.0;16.0;237.0;Posted: May 11

gOD tier game. I've so far have played through the whole series with a friend that also loves CO-OP games, and I have introduced other friends to these games, and they will forever be my favorite. The puzzles in this game to me are so much more different than the other ones.

The ONLY issue I found, is in some areas you advance to, there is a huge lag spike. It doesn't last for the entire puzzle but it is definitely something to take into consideration.";8.0;1.0;5.0;138.0;Posted: May 10

This game has a longer playtime than previous games but still feels worth your time. There are more puzzles added in comparison to other entries and they're longer.

There are some bugs (at release), especially when you ""die"" during the puzzle and are reset, some of which are visual or audio bugs. Some puzzles can get extremely frustrating not because the concept is complex but just because there's a very specific answer to the puzzle that will take some trial and error to get to.

But overall a really good experience, even if you haven't played the previous games before. The same lore is used so it's cool to see how it really ends. Make sure you bring a buddy who isn't too hotheaded.";11.3;1.0;2.0;62.0;Posted: May 14

Too short. That’s how I would summarize my experience playing this 4th ""We were here"" game.

Pros :
Art + atmosphere : It’s been a long journey since the first game (less than 1gb of storage space overall iirc). Beautiful.
Story : As for Art + atmosphere this game series has come a long way since the ""We’re stranded in a snowy mountain, let’s take refuge in this castle"". We Were Here Together was already a step in that direction but Forever is really going in the more ""Outdoor experience"".

Cons :










My pros/cons list seems to tip on the cons side I will because of Co-op puzzles. I really crave for this type of games. It’s a big bias but this kind of games where you have to work as a team of 2 to move forward is a really nice feeling for me when I'm playing a video game. I understand how it must be difficult to come up with new puzzles for 2 people to solve them together but so far the job has been done. I wouldn’t mind less story for a longer/more difficult 5th game.

TL;DR Game is good but short. We (my friend and I) need a 5th ""We Were Here"" game already.";10.3;1.0;2.0;391.0;Posted: May 14

As a huge fan of the previous We Were Here games I've been waiting for We Were Here Forever for a long time!
And I'm more than satisfied. It's a perfect continuation of the previous games (both puzzle- and lore-wise) and still manages to surprise and introduce tons of new puzzles and content.
Can't wait to finish the game, yet don't want it to end so I hope it's long!

I've played for 2-3 hours now and encountered some bugs, though. Mostly non-significant, but there's a huge bug that makes the in-game voicechat stop working (sometimes you stop hearing the other person until you press and release the push-to-talk button again), so I hope it gets fixed soon.

Total Mayhem has gone a long way since the first We Were Here game, and the direction is on point. Keep it up!";10.7;1.0;1.0;162.0;Posted: May 10

Feel like a proud father having played all the games starting back in February 2017. A truly fantastic 11 hour experience which was everything I wanted it to be. A must play (series not just this single game) that in my humble opinion, is better than the 2021 GOTY It Takes Two. No less than a 10/10 rating, fully worth buying at any price.


Every area was incredibly well thought out and produced.

This is a beautiful way to end the series. Plenty of beautiful wonderful puzzles. Each one made us think and wonder about. I played at launch so of course there were a handful of bugs, but I am certain many of them will be fixed soon but none of them were bad enough a quick restart wouldn't fix the issue. It however feels like if I play through it again I wouldn't have as much fun as the first three games. Only because both players were so close to each other for so much of the game. This of course isn't a problem at all just a note. Regardless whatever these creators make in the future I will happy support them.";10.6;1.0;1.0;410.0;Posted: May 12

I've played all 4 of the games in this series and even now, Were Here Too shines the brightest. Playing this one was very fun, as the puzzles are relatively complex, and the gameplay/.NET code has seen great improvements; however, I find it missing the same things We Were Here Together was missing as well as, new components that feel out of play or destroyed what it was I had originally desired in-game. Most of the game is spent together like the 3rd one, which if you enjoyed, you'll probably enjoy this game as well, but if you're like me and you enjoy the 1st and 2nd game, you may not like this title much. I won't go into spoilers, but this one felt very ""endgame""-esque, with the ending making me wish I hadn't wasted my money, and just quit after not enjoying the 3rd game. I really miss what brought to the table, and it makes me very sad to see how the story/gameplay went in";8.9;0.0;2.0;125.0;Posted: May 13

If this is an ending point to the series, this is probably the lowest note they could have ended on. It's still a good game, just in my opinion the worst in the series. Some of the puzzles were interesting and unique, others felt extremely lacking in content and how to solve them. Certain puzzles seemed very one-sided, such as one person having no fun helping solve the puzzle, leaving the puzzle up to your partner to solve almost by themselves. Other than that, some of the puzzles are buggy, requiring restarts of your game and frustration all around. I hope there is another in the series to redeem this one.";15.1;0.0;2.0;315.0;Posted: May 13

The lore and backstory for 'We Were Here Forever' is extraordinarily deep and engaging particularly in comparison to the mystery and vagueness of the last three games story wise. Unlike the past three games (which i also highly recommend particularly before playing this) which reveal very little lore wise behind the actions of the two explorers 'We Were Here Forever' completely changes that dynamic diving much deeper into the lore which myself and many others have very much been looking for. This game and the whole 'We Were Here' series is a must to experience with a friend. 10/10";34.8;1.0;1.0;65.0;Posted: May 12

This game is honestly one of the best co-op experiences out there, it truly tests your relationship with who you are playing with. How well can you forgive your partner at the end of the day. threw trials and frustration coming together is what this game is about! i however don't suggest this game to any couples that have poor communication skills and even worse ability to forgive one another for the outbursts of frustration that may and will ensue. But know the reward you gain is the understanding and deeper bonding you two may gain from understanding one another better and more deeply!";8.1;1.0;1.0;165.0;Posted: May 13

Do not buy until several bug fixing patches have been released, through 12 hrs so far and have experienced a bug that did not allow partner or I to progress through story, a bug that threw us threw the map, a bug that will not currently let me load from our checkpoint, thus functionally stopping our progress, and have had multiple areas that cause FPS drop / lag for no reason.

Story seems great, puzzles are decent, but due to bugs and performance issues this is not a worth buy until patches come out.";12.7;0.0;4.0;92.0;Posted: May 13

Played the first 3 games. This game is so buggy. I fell out of map at the end of chapter 5 and now my save wont load. I m not gonna start all over again and do the same ♥♥♥♥. I was so close to finishing this ♥♥♥♥. In chapter 3-4, game broke again without us even noticing. We stuck at somewhere so we tried quitting and loading our game back in, after doing that ""magically"" we were able to continue the game. We were supposed to do something that requires 2 men but my friend got stuck outside of the door. If we didnt notice that, we would waste so much time. I feel like that time is already wasted because of your stupid, gamebreaking bugs. By the way, this is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game in the series. That octopus puzzle was pure trial and error. So many answers you can give to it. Every chapter has a puzzle that is completely nonsense. If you take a look at my library, you can see that im a puzzle game fan but this one is totally ♥♥♥♥. Most of your puzzles are stupid af and really hard to understand. Tbh I got lucky at least 3 times and still dont know the logic behind them. Unfortunately, this is unacceptable and unplayable. AND WTF i completed a chapter with 10 fps. Poor optimization. REALLY LOW FPS with a decent computer. Im not gonna buy another game from you ever again.

This game has a game breaking bug that prevents further progression at the graveyard. One player is supposed to interact with locations marked on a map that the other player must describe. After the first one, they simply cannot be interacted with. Have spoken with other players in the official discord for this game and they have also encountered this error and had to try multiple restarts to work around, however, it is not guaranteed to work after a restart. For a puzzle game to have a bug that simply prevents progression I cant leave a good review for this game, shameful because I enjoyed the prior 3 games.";12.7;0.0;17.0;282.0;Posted: May 11

Written review below!

I am still recovering from the trauma that a couple of the puzzles in the last We Were Here game caused, but I can't deny I love the series.



We Were Here is a series of co-op puzzle adventure games that play kinda like an escape room - the catch being that your friend is usually not in the same room and you have to relay information verbally in order to solve puzzles. It’s unique, challenging, and can oftentimes be frustrating if you’re stuck trying to describe what you’re looking at, but it’s never not fun.

Forever continues all of this, just bigger and better in almost every way. The third game took my friend and I four hours to clear. This one though? It took us exactly double that time, just over eight hours. The studio really went all out in expanding on the series and making it this full-length thing while avoiding some of the common pitfalls that such puzzle games fall into.

For example, the game is longer, but it hardly recycles content. You are constantly going through new areas, like a castle, the snowy wilderness, a dimensional circus, or even an underwater cave system in a submarine. Half the excitement is waiting to see where the experience takes you next.

You get your simple visual puzzles where you must relay strange shapes to your buddy using just vocal descriptions, but also some creative riddle-solving puzzles and even puzzles that bend your perception of space.

One of my favorites, for example, was an audiovisual puzzle where I had to describe sound patterns and pitches to decipher what a giant squid was saying to us and then have my friend figure out the appropriate response in that same language. Despite my best efforts, both my friend and I struggled with this one because we were too busy laughing at my poor attempts to recreate squid language - but that is exactly what makes this game so great.

This is going to be very subjective depending on the players, but my friend and I only got hard stuck once here and it did not feel as long as the last game - where we got hard stuck on multiple puzzles. Maybe the difficulty overall was toned down, but there’s still a good sense of challenge here and it ultimately makes for a more engaging experience.

You get this absolutely solid journey up to that point and then a final chapter that doesn’t even have any real puzzles in it, instead just taking the form of a series of tasks before a cinematic and then the credits roll. It was disappointing considering the quality of everything that preceded it and left a stain on an otherwise solid experience.

With the increased length of the game comes an increased focus on story elements. You don’t really need to play the previous games to understand it and honestly, it’s such an afterthought to the rest of the experience that it hardly even feels necessary. It’s more so just there to connect these different environments together in a somewhat coherent manner, but don’t expect anything story-wise to really stick with you after the experience is over.

At two separate points, the game bugged out and phased my friend through the floor and ceiling - forcing both of us to reload the game to fix. Outside of that, no other issues to report. The game looks fine, has simple, yet effective controls, and runs well.

We Were Here Forever is the best in the series yet. At double the length, it brings all the crazy puzzles that the series has become known for, just bigger and better. It’s creative, has plenty of variety, and is also challenging, yet not unfair. Even if you have yet to play any games in the series, this one is definitely worth a look, it’s one of the better co-op experiences I have played in a while.

Bought this for myself and a friend. Then we were unable to play it as it got stuck on a black screen loading the first level. We tried everything; deleting the appdata dir, running under dx11, forwarding firewall ports, changing network region, disabling crossplay, etc. Nothing worked, finally decided to give up after spending a full hour attempting to get the game to load and ask for a refund. I'm pretty disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying it.";0.9;0.0;4.0;658.0;Posted: May 11

I know the developers don't want to deal with supporting Linux, and that's fine - but it's a disappointment that all 3 previous games worked fine under Proton and this one won't launch because it can't connect to their voice chat server under Proton.

I've never used the in-game voicechat in any of the previous three (just eaiser to use Mumble/Discord/etc.), and it seems dumb that, because there's no option to not use their server, the entire game is unplayable for me.

I may try it on my Windows machine later, but the decision to not allow connections to the Vivox voice server to be skipped (since even on Windows I'll still be using Mumble) makes this a massive thumbs down for me until/unless that changes.";0.2;0.0;38.0;507.0;Posted: May 11

Big fan of the series and eagerly awaiting this release. It was disappointing, to say the least. It feels incredibly clunky with similar puzzles from the previous games. The camera angles and level design leave a lot to be desired. Whereas the old games felt fun to explore and push through this felt unpolished and painful to move around.";2.0;0.0;4.0;290.0;Posted: May 11

I do recommend this game. Its a really good and fun puzzle game, not once we had a moment we totally didnt get it and had to look up how to solve puzzles. (though i still dont understand the kraken puzzle) Yet i absoluetly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate this kind of endings. My god is it really so hard to make some kind of secret or something to get both players to be alive in the end? With no such ending i cannot give it a positive review, this just purely sucks. Next time i die for my friend ingame, i will shoot myself irl >:(";10.2;0.0;3.0;188.0;Posted: May 11

It is nearly impossible to play this with a friend do to the puzzle game play. I dont mind puzzle games and I dont mind a good challenge but this was too much. If you want to play a game where you have to understand the rules of the mini games your playing then also have to navigate who your playing with. If you like games that will frustrate you and your friend at the same time this game is for you.";2.6;0.0;4.0;9.0;Posted: May 10

The game is good, bugs at least met a couple of times. There are many interesting puzzles, but there are also bad ones like the coffin level.

Thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of this series, but this one has by far been the best.
We Were Here Forever offers more insight into the lore behind the other games and features well-thought-out pleasantly frustrating puzzles, with stunning environments and cut scenes.
There were a few bugs but nothing that ruined game play.
Highly recommended to anybody who has played the previous games.";13.2;1.0;1.0;15.0;Posted: May 14

Me and my partner have been obsessed with this series for a while now and we have both been blown away with We Were Here Forever. Trust me, it was worth the wait for release! It's puzzles are far more diverse to the others in the We Were Here series, which is always a good thing. It's lovely how communication is vital in puzzles to complete this game, and plays on your trust in one another. Its visuals are stunning, storyline & lore is a strong addition and well crafted in comparison to their other games and despite the odd bug here and there (which you'll always find in games) it is a beautiful game to play and definitely my favourite puzzle game I've ever played, and even after the game has ended, it leaves you with more questions than what you began with. This game and series, as well as it’s developers, deserve way more hype and far more popularity and this game is very cheap considering how incredible it is, for me personally I believe it should be worth much more! It is clear Total Mayhem Games has put so much effort into this game and I hope they either conclude this series or continue with the amazing work. 100% would recommend!!";12.4;1.0;1.0;22.0;Posted: May 14

Easily one of the best puzzle games I've had the pleasure of enjoying with a friend.
The atmosphere is unnerving and interesting, and the puzzles are surprisingly varied and very creative.
Even though my adventuring partner and I met each new challenge with a collective groan, we shouldered them together and made it through.

The game briefly treating us to proximity chat however, did make me wish that this was possible throughout the game, as the priority system makes it difficult to banter while puzzling, for fear of silencing the other.";10.8;1.0;0.0;323.0;Posted: May 14

This is one of the best puzzle games , and without a doubt the best co-op puzzle game, i have ever played. it really nails the feel of the world, the story, and the focus on puzzle solving and communication.
1 person never can see the full solution, but have to communicate with the partner to solve it, so the way co-op puzzleing should work.
The only down side is the lack of replayabillity (you can play this game once, and only once), but that is a price i'm willing to pay for such good puzzles.";10.2;1.0;0.0;520.0;Posted: May 14

I really love this game and want to recommend this game. However the game-breaking bug caused me to not be able to continue to last chapter.
It's caused by using 'play without save' which was the solution for another bug, caused the collective progress in last chapters not saved throughout the sessions.

I will update the review if there is the solution to this without playing the whole game again.";12.4;0.0;0.0;305.0;Posted: May 14

Played all the games in this series and I love each and every one. 8/10 Love it.

Now some puzzles were a bit confusing and me and my friend couldn't really understand but we were able to wing it and somehow figure it out. There are two things that each took a point (and one of them varies from each person).

The first one is the frame issues. Some areas KILLED my fps to the point where it hard to move, let alone enjoy. Thankfully it went away after the initial load or if I didn't look in a certain direction in one area but it did ruin the experience a bit.

As for the second part it was because of a phobia. I won't go into details cause the area is spoilers but all I want is the option to hide them or change how they look in some way.

Overall, good stuff. Get a friend and prepare to scream at each other over what shape is more phallic and who is forgetting to share a crucial detail.";9.1;1.0;0.0;209.0;Posted: May 14

the scale is incredible and the puzzles present you with a lot of communication tests between you and your partner. This leads to funny situations and chaos when you're frantically rushing to save your partner. The story feels fresh and new compared to the other games too. In the last games we knew a bit about the lore in little pieces but everything ties together in this game and the true Castle Rock secret was revealed.. Some cut scenes and transitions were a bit buggy but that's because this is the first time Total Mayhem has built a We Were Here game on a scale like this and with the quality that was presented, i'd be happy to take that trade off. This game is best played with a partner predetermined so you can work well together and have the most fun. LFG does exist but when you join, you join at the host's progress so you'll start at different places most likely each time you play. I played with my best friend which i would recommend you do. Buy this game, you won't regret it.";12.4;1.0;0.0;86.0;Posted: May 14

One of the best co-op games I've played since It Takes Two and Portal 2 co-op. Has fantastic and unique puzzle design with a story that is detailed but not complex or hard to understand. With the exception of a couple puzzles in here, most of these puzzles are pretty decent head-scratchers. Tough in a refreshing way but very much solvable. I don't think I've had this much fun trying to figure out HOW a puzzle works rather than just the puzzle itself. NOTE: As of writing this review, this game has a plethora of optimization issues resulting in fps drops any time an area is loaded, deloaded, etc, as well as a pretty decent amount of bugs that usually occur due to clicking an interactable to many times or something not triggering. (spoiler I guess:) During the graveyard/robbing section we had to reset the level about 4 times for it to actually work. Which was very frustrating. Despite these issues the game shines through and makes them more minor inconveniences then anything. Plus these are things that can be fixed with a couple patches. So in conclusion, while I highly recommend playing this, it would not hurt to wait for these things to be fixed before playing.";9.5;1.0;0.0;51.0;Posted: May 14

The environment was great, the puzzles are just the right amount of challenging, and my god are the visuals amazing. I did have some stuttering issues when loading into a new puzzle; however, once I let the game render for a few seconds all was well.

I've always loved the series. Myself and a friend were playing through, as we always do, and in chapter 1: the momento, you both spawn in and cannot go anywhere. We tried hosting the game, each of us, and one person would load in while the other sits at a black screen. It is consistent, and not making us spawn on opposite sides of the map to complete the puzzle. Now we are stuck. Please fix this.

I'm not really a review writer but I really want to support the studio for making such fun experiences through their games.
The riddles/puzzles are diverse (even compared to the older games). Some can be more challenging than others but everything is totally manageable after some time and thought.
I dont know how it's like to play with random players (maybe more fun.. or more exhausting?) but if you're playing with a friend be patient with each other... because.. both of u.. will feel like bigbrains.. and idiotic fools at times.
There is no inbetween.

Anyway. Everything was as good as expected but for me the story telling was the most outstanding part compared to the older games.
We thoroughly enjoyed it and I can't wait for my bad memory to kick in, so I can further test the limits of my other friends' tolerance. :)";16.5;1.0;0.0;95.0;Posted: May 13

All the puzzles have been set in with intriguing concepts and the environment the puzzles are put in feel right with the location and really make each area fun to move around in and look around. This game has been a big step up from the other games with its graphics and how more story-driven we are as the characters when moving around to move to different areas from how it felt back in We Were Here and We Were Here Too. Big improvement!

The environment I can tell has been put in with a lot of effort and only being somewhat halfway in the game so far I can say I would recommend it to a pair of friends to play for themselves knowing that the content given so far (Up to chapter 6 as of writing this) has felt worth its price and there is only more content to come which I look forward to doing.";15.0;1.0;0.0;45.0;Posted: May 13

Definitely the best game of the series, but still has some issues that make it seem like the developers are still struggling to figure out where they want this series to go :

- A lot of puzzles rely on one person doing next to nothing while the other player has to figure everything by himself

- Out of my 9h playthrough, I would say more than 1h is just walking around to go from one area to the other or to bring back an item to a specific place

- There are some really uneven areas / puzzles throughout the game. Sometimes you'll get puzzles that are very easy and you'll storm through an area, whereas some other times you'll spend more than 1h in the same area.

Other than these, I'd say it's a pretty good game to play with a friend, especially if you enjoyed the other games.";8.9;1.0;0.0;1139.0;Posted: May 13

i played all the game and can say this the always a game me and my brother look forward to playing together. i would recommend playing this game but the also have his downsides, The Jester is the main villain of the game but it does not feel like it. He doesn't pressure us to complete puzzle fast, he doesn't make me feel like he really hates us and wants to get rid of us and maybe the most important of them all is that it doesn't feel like we are trying to ""fight"" him while completing the puzzles. overall i would say worth the time to play tho. 7/10";11.7;1.0;0.0;96.0;Posted: May 13

Genuinely one of the best games I've played, especially when in context of the series as a whole. I highly recommend you play not just this game, but ALL 4 of the games in order, with a friend you think is good with communication and puzzles. Worth every penny, and every second was thoroughly enjoyed. Puzzles are REALLY cool and different, very hard without
having confusing rules, and in so many fun environments.

Highly suggest not looking up any of the puzzle solutions, in this game in the series at least.

We did have the occasional visual bugs, and 2 easily fixed softlock bugs that required us to leave and come back on a ski lift (did not lose any progress). And another in a crypt (also did not lose any progress).

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Songs of Conquest is a Heroes of Might and Magic inspired strategy game, but with several unique twists on the old formula (which for the most part improve the game in my opinion).

SoC has a gorgeous strategy layer where you manage and collect resources and build up your towns for unit recruitment. First and foremost SoC is a military conquest game at heart, and economy is only a means to acquire better and bigger armies, so this is not a Civilization game. If your heroes enter combat on the strategy layer (both against neutral mobs and other players) the conflict will be resolved in short tactical battles on a hex grid (usually 3-5 turns so the battles don't overstay their welcome). For those with little patience for easy battles - they can just be auto-resolved and a real ai-vs-ai battle is fought by the game ""in the background"" to deliver you the end results. You can also somewhat adapt the starting positions of your troops before entering/auto-resolving the battle.

Many players will be familiar with Heroes of Might and Magic so I'll just list some main points how this game differs:

- There is no separate ""city screen"" and instead you build recruitment and economy/research buildings directly on the strategy map around your cities. There are limited slots so no single city can do everything. There are also different sizes from villages to towns to cities. More ""neutral"" economy and recruitment buildings are spread all around the map but they can't be improved, you just ""flag"" them by visiting them with your army and then they provide their benefit to you.

- The number of max. troops in a single unit is limited (can be increased via research, imo better than in HoMM).

- The number of units a hero (aka. ""wielder"") can command is limited but can be increased on level-ups.

- The number of wielders is limited but can be increased via the number and level of your owned cities.

- Mana (aka. ""essence"" which is mana with ""flavor"") for battlefield spells is generated each time a unit gets their turn in the turn order, so your army composition and faction mainly determines your available spells. (Along with items and level-up skills so you can mix and match).

- The spells are pretty varied and with some well-planned utility spells you can really swing the odds in your favor. The spells really open up your tactical options, as it should be.

- Each faction has 8 ""basic"" troops which can be upgraded to a significantly stronger (visually distinct) version for a total of ~16 troops per faction (currently 4 factions, more are planned if the game does well) and then there's some neutral mobs like wolves as well. The upgraded version of a troop also typically has some form of additional battlefield ability that can be activated. The troop variety is decent, most have a useful battlefield role to fill but some balancing will surely be done as the game goes through early access.

- The tactical battles feature terrain height with higher terrain usually giving damage buffs to range and melee attacks. There's also obstacles, but they only impede movement, they do not affect ranged attacks.

- In early access SoC currently features 2 campaigns with 4 missions each. Doesn't sound much but the maps get big quickly. I played both campaigns and they are already very polished (both gameplay- and story-wise) and the story really adds flavor to the varied factions and wielder characters so they become more memorable. It also serves a pretty good tutorial which then gradually transitions into a fairly challenging game. It's already good and I hope more will be coming if the game does well.

- There's of course things that need some improvement. Highest up on my personal list is simultaneous turns for multiplayer and even more balancing and more official maps (oh yeah there's a map editor and there's already maybe two dozen maps made by other alpha testers).

- The devs are amazing and responsive and based on my interaction with them during my time as an alpha tester I have no doubt they will manage to improve the game as we go forward with early access. There's even an in-build bug/feedback tool (press b-b-b) that grabs a screenshot and you can then describe and paint on it what's wrong and send it over so that it gets fixed (and they are quick!). That said the game is really well rounded already and you should not expect to experience many bugs.";51.5;1.0;346.0;607.0;Posted: 10 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So good I can ignore the bad
I know you, reader. Potential buyer. You're me. You look for negativity first in a game to see if there's any deal breakers. So, here's the bottom line up front.

Yes, Early Access, yes, it's not actually deal breakers (I'm not sorry for the bait), but the game does still have a few issues. Keep in mind, I'm writing this on day one of EA release.

- The AI is quirky and cheesable. The bots brains still need a bit of tuning. After a few hours of play you'll start to notice some inefficiencies, then you'll figure out that they are overly biased over certain targets, then you'll underestimate the AI and get curbstomped without warning because it's still pretty competent.
- Building hitboxes sometimes making it almost impossible to click on the road behind them, artsy art making me use the Highlight Interactables key every turn, unit abilities being on top of the unit's field sprite making me essentially play the boring version of whack-a-mole... And yet, I had to squeeze my memory really hard to come up with these. Most of the UX is very, very good, and that leads me to believe that all these problems will be fixed as soon as the devs get around to them.
- Don't get confused: the is top-notch. I'm talking about the titular Songs that you get as reward after finishing a campaign mission. Maybe I was expecting too much, but a few of them are not on the same level as the rest of the game. To be clear, this is a bit like complaining that the cutscenes aren't super polished. Which, let's be fair, they're not what most people play strategy games for. I'm reaching, I know, but I really needed a third bullet point my brother in Barya

I've been involved in the alpha testing, and it was to have a few passionate discussions in the feedback channels and wake up a few weeks later with a patch that addressed our concerns in a much smarter way that we could have ever come up with, as players.

The devs are receptive, careful, productive, and somehow still human beings. Am I biased because I was lucky enough to have interacted with them dozens of times? Absolutely. But, that's also why they're so great.

Oh, did I mention that they worked like mules to hotfix critical bugs as fast as possible, so many times I lost count? Or that they took the time to ask for clarification about feedback, never trying to be defensive and always making us feel listened to?


The game is a banger. But, it's good. I can't go back to Heroes of Might and Magic, it just lacks something now. The new stack system is something I never thought I wanted, and now I can't live without it. The concept of tying mana (""essence"") into unit composition, encouraging many small stacks that can be easily sniped for a morale buff, is both elegant and almost obvious in retrospect.

Even if balance isn't the main focus for such a Single-Player and Casual-MP focused game, everything you do feels so meaningful, every unit, every spell, with their place and role strongly defined, allowing for a great many combos of valid playstyles. I've been experimenting with weird build orders and unit compositions and, if you can theory-craft it, you can probably make it work.


The game draws you in and never lets go. The sound design, the art, the animations and the of it all... The art direction is strong, the execution is better.

The UX is so stupidly satisfying I'll get into a manual battle, even though I could lose no units in quick battle, just so I can spam the battlefield with spells and crack and splat and shoop my enemies into pulp.

Okay that's it. I can't think of a nice conclusion right now, writing all this was a bad idea. Hold my essence while I spend the entire evening bullying giant faeries from the safety of my artillery line-";100.7;1.0;254.0;324.0;Posted: 10 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As a tactics veteran, lover of HoMM, Age of Wonders, Disciples etc who spend hundreds of hours in various strategy tactic games, it pains me to put thumbs down on SoC.

Since the announcement in PC Gaming Show in 2019, I was super hyped for this game and had high expectations as developers constantly teased a high quality production on their social media / discord.

Don't get me wrong, the game looks gorgeous, probably the best 2.5D pixel art in recent years in video games. It's very professional and it feels like most budgets were spent on pixel art lead designers. Music, sound design, atmosphere, and UI is outstanding. And yet, it all doesn't really matter if core gameplay is flawed to the point it can be considered shallow for strategy/tactics games standards.

The battles. The battles are promoted as fast paced, and devs weren't kidding with that. After playing for a bit with various factions, it feels like you are just bashing your army without strategy into the enemy army and that's it. There is almost no strategy in battles. Your units doesn't have Wait/Defend commands (unless it's special unit active skill), [EDIT: this is very sensitive design choice, it cannot be touched, so if you really dislike it, well, it's okay, there are other games] magic is a huge letdown and adds minimum to excitement in combats/tactics layer (later more on magic), there is no line of sight in game so game have bias towards ranged units as they just provide free dps (on top of that, some ranged units literally can attack through whole map and you cannot hide from ranged attacks), you have a hard cap on units per stack (King's Bounty style) so game promotes bashing stacks of units as disposable trash and quickly refill army as each unit generates each day (HoMM 4 style). You cannot win battles without losing units unless you are severely overpowered. And it's by the design of the game, you will just bash and bash until one side dies.

Now let's move on to the Magic system. I believe this is probably the most unique feature of the game and in my personal opinion, it's where devs went too hard to create something unique, but in reality, it's not as fun and exciting. There are 5 orbs of different essences (mana) in the game, and each stack of units in battles gives you mana each their turn, so you start the battle with lets say 2 essence (from Hero bonus), your 1st unit goes, you get 1 essence, then 2nd unit gives you more essence, etc and each unit stacks have 1 or 2 different mana types they give or 2x same ones. So what's the essence(mana) used for? You guessed it, spells. There are no schools of magic, there are no levels, tiers. [EDIT: That's not true. Tiers exist but they are exclusive Hero Level Up passive which you also need to get lucky to get if your Hero isn't directly Mage-type from get-go] Only 4 very basic spells for each type of mana exist + 20 mixed spells with 2 types of mana. Spells are shallow and basic, with effects like +-Def +-Offense, +-Initiative, +-Damage, +-Resistance, Low damage spells (that some essences don't even have like Order), and these damage ones are so pathetic, ""Armageddon"" is 25 damage to all troops, that's literally not enough to kill 1 Tier2 unit and yes, before you ask, you can increase damage with Tiers promotions (Hero level up passive) but it's still not as going to be as epic as you think. Creativity of tactics/strategy within spells gets somewhat damaged because entire combat is supposed to be complete in ~3 full rounds with bashing units into other units. There are no overworld spells, no complicated spells that make HoMM / Age of Wonders battles exciting. In fact, those spells look like Hearthstone Heroes ability (they even look similar in UI), with their effect being minor unless you have very mage-focused Wielder/army setup. And since there is no more Mana pool/1spell per turn system, you have different tactical decisions to make. No more of: saving mana for upcoming battles, spending it sparingly or use it all on powerful spells to turn the tide of battle and then restore mana. But instead: which unit stacks to use for what essence generation and what kind of essence build to make. There are some very OP setups you can do because you can stack spell effects like Essence (+100%) generation on a unit before they get their turn, so you will get tons of Essence very fast early in combat and can nuke stuff with Tier 3 spells each round you circle your units turns. [EDIT: I fixed some of my incorrect views about magic in SoC after playing more, but my overall feel is still the same. The system was designed that way and it does add more strategy to battles, but only in context of SoC's mechanics]

Unit hard cap per stack (that you can upgrade slightly with Research upgrades) is something I don't really get. [EDIT: It's PvP focused balance decision] It makes the game less of classic strategy titles that SoC is supposed to be inspired by, and more of the King's Bounty RPG. It's further confirmed in their campaign design, it feels like an RPG indeed.  Speaking of current EA single player content: 4 factions. 2 campaigns. Each 4 missions. Writing of campaigns is very forgettable and nothing special. Just many lore terms that you don't even have any connection with. And not many characters at all to get some kind of exposition.

Combat deployment is also something I don't get. You literally get random tiles on the deployment screen to select. Not like ""Tactics skill"" in HoMM. And the game promotes highground tiles because they just give flat bonuses for attack and defence. [EDIT: It's not actually random, but based of your Wielder's physical position and there are presets of ""battlefield"" maps]

Artifacts in SoC are pretty boring as well. Basic stats for the most part. Just +stats, find yourself a better one and gg, you have best in the slot.

Game doesn't have a random generator of maps. No ASync turns / Simultaneous turns for multiplayer. Tutorials are pretty rough. New players will struggle at first how to build your cities (as you have limited slots to what build in each city), so you can mess up ""build orders"" easily, the game doesn't really explain a lot of things (in combat too). A lot of Early Access small/minor oopsies which most likely will be polished in a few patches so I won't be writing them here (like music not looping in Main Menu). Some confusing game settings that don't have a popup or explanation of what they are doing (I am looking at you, ""AI framerate budget"").

Game completely lacks Key Bindings in options and you cannot check in-game ANY controls at all. You have no idea what each button does. The only time you get explanations of controls are during delayed tutorials and during few UI elements popouts.

Wielders (Heroes) level ups are also simplified, most skills are basically flat/boring +stats or leadership(more unit stacks slots unlocks). No special synergy within skills, or complicated systems with masteries that unlock special bonuses and combos.

I am not gonna go too much into details of City Screen (that SoC doesn't have btw, instead cities have slots to build stuff in, I personally find this gameplay design nice and fresh), there are a lot of variables to talk about for each faction, including economy and other decision making. But again, it doesn't matter because most of the important gameplay for me personally is not fun. The combats/tactics/strategy are ruined for me. So I have very little reason to enjoy the game.

I think if you are new to this genre and not a veteran of older franchises, this will be very exciting for you to try out, especially with all its beautiful presentation. Just don't forget about the price tag and EA status.

Songs of Conquest;"Posted: 12 May
EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Let me just preface this review with some reflections on emulating a dominating game for a genre of games and the role of nostalgia in video games. Mostly because I think it's relevant to a game like Songs of conquest and is very upfront about its inspiration from heroes of might and magic 3.

in all types of games, there is this one game, that other devs try to emulate. A game that for many fans, is the one pinnacle of this kind of game.
For 4x games, its Civilization. As soon as a game like it, people say ""oh, is as good civ?"" (humankind is a good example of this. Or the game Old world made by former Civ devs.)
For 4x games set in space, it's Master of Orion 2. As soon as a game like this is out, people say oh is it as good as MOO2? (galactic civilizations 2, endless space 1/2 come to mind along with, Stellaris)

but then when it comes to Turn-based strategy games set in a fantasy universe one game always comes to mind. And it is - if you like me started gaming in 90ish - its Heroes of might and magic 3.
Like so many, I have played heroes 3 for many hours with several friends. One of my friends says it's one of the best games ever made - period. I might not fully agree with that since there are just others games that I like more. I know that's blasphemy for some heroes 3 fans to say but that's how I see it. For instance, there are UI elements and other things that would need an update. As much as I like the game I also do think that nostalgia is a strange thing. And the thing about it is, that ""nostalgia is always better yesterday"" as a danish actor said once. nostalgia can sometimes but not always make us against changing things - especially if we are nostalgic about a need for something, which other later products haven't been able to meet. And even more so if you feel that sequels changed things for the worse. That it was just change, without any reason.
Most heroes fans will know how around after heroes 5, and possibly already with heroes 4, things started to take a nosedive in the quality of the games. Especially with heroes 7 which had a buggy launch. Currently, Ubisoft is just sitting on the rights to the IP and not trying to make a new full-blown singleplayer focused game. It's mostly just smaller and pretty bad mobile games. Why that is I might return to later in this.


Then Songs of Conquest comes along from a small indie company aided by Lavapotion as a publisher.
And of course, again the question from those considering buying it is ""is this as good as heroes 3?"" will this fill the void that has been created by Ubisoft in not making a good heroes game for many years?

Well, let me tell you that several elements are certainly the same. And you can already hear how that makes a lot of heroes 3 fans at ease. ""great! so I know what I can go into and let me enjoy a nostalgia trip""
for instance:

- turn-based combat with different factions, and units with their own strengths and weakness
- a focus on heroes that earn experience points
- you conquer towns and build them up


but let me also tell you that something is indeed different from the well-known Heroes 3 formula:

- mana/ spells

there is no fixed mana pool or pool of spell points. At the start of the game, in every combat, you gain points that you use to cast spells. But the big difference is these points (called essence) depend on the number of stacks of troops your field and their type. For instance, if you place human archers you gain 1 ""order"" essence pr stack of archers. so if you have 3 stacks of archers you gain 3 order essence pr turn to cast spells.

- army management and the number of slots you have for units.

This slides over to what is different in terms of army management. And especially the number of unit slots. In heroes 3 you could have 7 slots that you could place any units in. But in Songs of conquest, the system is different. Here the number of unit slots is depend on skill choices and your hero. This means that if you want a bigger army than 3 stacks, you have to use level-ups to unlock more unit slots. I currently have mixed feelings about this. It's a bit boring that you have to use your level-ups/ skill points just to be able to field more units, without any other bonus. If the skills that gave you more units also provided some active skills that would for instance increase morale, it would be a lot cooler.
Also, I do find it a bit limiting on the player that I cant have 5 stacks of archers to spread my units out which is a classic heroes 3 tactic to get more shots on the enemy.
limiting the player's tactical freedom in this way isnt a good thing. But on the other hand, it's not a major deal-breaker. But it's a system I feel needs some improvements for it to work better. But that's what early access is for.

- city management - more inspired by Civ than heroes 3
In terms of City management, it's more like civilization 6 where you don't have a central city but buildings are made on the campaign map as separate things on building titles.
Building titles can range from small, medium to large. Currently, it's a bit of a strange system because, yes some buildings are required to build others. For instance, to get a castle, and to recruit mounted knights as the human order faction, you need to build a lumber yard. But here is the strange thing; once you have built the castle you can just demolish the lumber yard without any consequence other than lower wood income. And you can use the build slot where the lumber yard was, for something else. I guess it's more dynamic than heroes 3 where you could not demolish buildings and use them for something different once you build them.


conclusion:
It's still a good game mind you. It just needs the tweaking that the early access is there for. There are very few bugs at this stage. That must have taken a lot of work.
I also think that the story in the campaigns could be told in a better way. Currently, its a lot of pop-up messages that you have to read. I was pretty in invested at the start, but after a while, I started skipping them. The best thing is the cut scenes in between missions where a bard sings what happened - a lot more of that would be great.
Appealing to the Heroes 3 fan base for a game is not as easy as one might think. Some devs for heroes 7 got death threats during development (!) because some fans that the game wasn't going to be as good as heroes 3. This is, of course, absurd but I do feel it expresses how afraid some heroes 3 fans are when someone tries to emulate the big classical game that they hold so dearly. Let me just say this: just because Song of conquest isnt a 1:1 copy of heroes 3 doesn't mean it can be a good game. Which I think it is!
Every game in a style of gaming doesn't have to be like the dominant game of that style of gaming to be good. Otherwise, innovation in gaming would just not happen. I know that arguments have sometimes been used to create really bad games that are not true to what inspired them. But in the hands of this small indie dev company I feel I trust them to make something that is a great experience even if it's different from heroes 3.
With the current version, I am looking forward to what the devs will do in terms of co-op and/or hot set mode, new campaigns besides the two that currently are in the game, and new features.

I am going to keep an interested eye on the journey of this game and its devs.

I wish them all the best of luck.";7.3;1.0;74.0;575.0;Posted: 12 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Disclosure, this is my first time making an Early Access game review so if you have questions ask away in the comments. I was also part of the alpha testing for 2 years.

Gameplay
The game follows the rules of Heroes of Might and Magic but less with the problems it had.
Such as teleporting around with a town portal or ""poor man's town portal"", or having a high-speed unit on your army and waiting until you rush the enemy with Mass Haste.
Or having or needing a limitless doom stack to kill your foes.

So what changed?

Heroes are wielders. There is no mana like in heroes however there is essence. Essences are gained from your units and with them, you can cast spells. You gain more unit slots from level ups.
No complex movement formula like in the Heroes series is based on unit movement and terrain. Units can buff themselves either by ability or passives.

There is no more hit and run tactics. However, you could always plan and use a secondary wielder (or hero) to weaken the foe's main army. Losing your main wielder in some maps is never the end if you are able to create a secondary wielder. Units have stack limits. Hiring wielders requires you to have towns upgraded and to control wielders. As well as an option for what wielder you want to hire.

There will be some familiar things from Heroes in Songs of Conquest. I have been enjoying this game and have over 500 hours in the game. Eager to see it grow.
They're also a map editor which I had fun making maps. Made 7 so far as of writing this. They may not be the best but was fun making them.

So far the campaign is of Arleon and Rana. Both have 4 maps each. They are both good at storytelling. It's rather similar to Heroes where you get a text about what is happening.
Each campaign explains how the faction was formed. What was the cause of it? Why are they doing what they are doing and their point of view?

My only critique is that they are short and I would love to have more maps as well as to know more about the world! However, you will love completing the maps as you are rewarded with a song as well. It's amazing! I only have 1 issue with one map in Arleon but I can get over it here.

I hope to see Loth and Barya be added. As well as story skirmish maps. I am looking forward to seeing more.

I will keep this short as I don't look into graphics into games. I barely take notice. However the pixel art is amazing! It's top notch and love every second of it. I only wish I was able to slow down the animations in battle.

It's not bad for me. My PC right now is:
Settings: Medium (both Graphics and terrain)
OS: Windows 10
Processor: ntel(R) Core(TM) i5-1035G1 CPU @ 1.00GHz 1.19 GHz
GPU: Intel(R) UHD Graphics
Memory: 20 GB
I play on medium setting (for all) and in windowed mode. It can run well in full screen as well.







They (the devs) listen to feedback and do check what people say. So don't feel discouraged to give your feedback and one more last thing. If you do encounter a bug in the game. Use the in-game bug report tool or press b three time. Helps the devs more then saying what happened on steam forums or in the discord. That is if you are able to report it. If the game crashes it's worth telling what happened.

Last but not least.
Songs of Conquest has been delightful and fun. I enjoyed seeing the game developed over the 2 years and I hope it continues. The devs are amazing people and I only wish them the best. To me it is inspiring. I was a tester for over 2 years. There is more to come from the game. I have high hopes.";513.6;1.0;86.0;155.0;Posted: 12 May

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There's a storyline, the building is limited so you have to strategically pick and choose, and there's camps that block your way until your army is strong enough to defeat them, as is standard with this style of game. However, I actually prefer Heroes at this point.

Where I get discouraged is the unit limits. Part of the fun of Heroes was making insanely large numbers of units. Having a maximum, and low one at that, seems unnecessary. At least cap it much higher than it is, especially at the base, and let us train all the units at once. It's actually a game-breaker for me because when the enemy has large armies it feels like I'm forced to play with just enough to win the harder camps. So I spend most of the game running out to fight a camp, returning and ending rounds to get all the units back, repeat. Heroes' system was more so take a large army and do as much stuff as you could until you needed to replenish your army - allowing for the freedom to explore.

The maps also seem pathed - like you must go in a certain path and there's no second path around. Reminds me of one of those open-world games that stretch the meaning of open-world by forcing you to stay on the path and not allow you into the forest.

I don't know - I just wanna play Heroes now instead. Might update this review later if they make some quality of life fixes.";3.2;0.0;103.0;195.0;Posted: 13 May

Don't let the 'Early Access' tag fool you. Songs of Conquest is very polished. A true successor to the HoMM series (and other similar titles such as Kings Bounty/Age of Wonders); SoC is perhaps the most beautiful pixel art video game I have ever seen. Everything from graphics, to music/sound design, to gameplay is nothing short of stellar. I can tell this is gonna be my game of the year. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for SoC.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
First game of 2022 that I enjoyed.
Also one of the first games that brings so much memories of playing Heroes.
The emphases is on army building, which I love, since in heroes magic got to overpowered that you can literaly kill an army with 2 spells.
PROS:
Get this game, its the best 30 $ you will ever spend.
It has new mechanics that are nice and add depth to the combat.
The artwork is a superbly done, love labor.
The city mechanic is nice that you need to constantly shift things around and its not capped on every building in the main city, its spread out.
The music is also a strong suite.
CONS:
Little aspects like UI, needs to be improved, but since its an alpha, there is room if the Devs will listen.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Put simply, Songs of Conquest has the most beautiful pixel art I've ever seen, with fantastic animations and plenty of style and polish to go around. The game's core loop is very reminiscent of the Heroes of Might and Magic series and is very well done. While I haven't explored all that SoQ has to offer, I can tell that it's going to be an indie darling and when it finally reaches v1.0 next year, there will be much to like.

As it stands now, it's already the best homage to Heroes of Might and Magic that I've personally ever played and I'm incredibly excited to play more of it in the coming months and years. Here's hoping that it sells well enough to see more and more content added to it over time and see more factions, etc.

Lavapotion is really on to something here. You should definitely support this endeavor.";3.4;1.0;19.0;604.0;Posted: May 10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR: This game is decent if you never played any HoMM game and wanna give a try. Otherwise set your expectation low as this is an indie game.

+ Pros:
+ Reasonably lightweight and runs okay on an office laptop. Only 2.6G on hard drive and uses 1.5G ram. There are lags here and there but overall it is well-optimized for a small indie game.
+ Sprite art is good. It does not feel cheap and animated very well. Probably the best pixel art game I have played.
+ Even for EA it still comes with map editor. If you want to explore some of the game mechanics, or play some sandbox, you can use the map editor like a lab and figure things out.

- Cons:

Game mechanics are really shallow, even compared to HoMM2. One of the charms of HoMM that gives it long replay-ability and long-term vitality is its many combinations of hero skills, creature abilities, spells and artifacts. These combinations can often yield overpowered tactics. A simple example would be HoMM3, using Armageddon with black dragon, or HoMM4, chaos + order with genie, or HoMM5, last stand vampires. This is the ""hero build"" concept in HoMM.

This game has none of that.




On top of that, this game has the mainstream problem of ""limiting players as much as possible"" trend.





And many more. In general, this game feels like someone took out the skeleton of HoMM2, put on even more constraints, and release it as a game. It is definitely enjoyable to play the campaign for the first few hours, but it will run dry very quickly. Don't expect this game to last long and have a huge community like HoMM.

And to end on a more constructive note, the designers of this game should not worry about limiting the players that much. Some noobs may only get by with some cheesy tactics, or with massive army hordes. So what? Let him have fun while the high-level players can win with solid fundamentals and show it to the noobs. Make the game creative and ham, and trust the players to figure it out.";9.1;0.0;83.0;167.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Long-term Heroes of Might and Magic player (since first to fourth, later ones didn't made it imho), I awaited this one with joy.
Lucky at a raffle, I made the Apha-testing team and played around 250 hours before Early Access release.
Long story short : It's an excellent game, with the HoMM ""dna"", but it's not ""a HoMM"", it's its own thing… and one I will follow for the (hopefully long) years to come with great pleasure.

The setting, lore and world-building is fine. Certainly a bit ""young"" since it's a first time, but crafted with love and yet the ambition of doing something new.
Graphics are too love-crafted and beautiful. Here too, I think it may only be better from this point on, but that doesn't mean it's not gorgeous at this point, just that as I said before it's a first try and I think the designs will evolve in the same good direction than the rest with time and feedback.
Music is good too, a lot of effort has been put in that field and honestly, the result sounds pretty awesome.
The game itself is the most important thing in this kind of title, and lava potion managed to find a good formula indeed. Of course, there are tweaks here and there, but the core system is here, innovative and solid. Maybe more important, the team is very open to player's feedback without ""compromising"" too much, and staying real with their first (and imho good) ambitions adn ideas.
As a HoMM player, I had to re-consider a lot of my habits, but only to find that (eventually and with great pleasure) this game didn't give me the urge to play HoMM, but to play it again for itself.
The map editor is an excellent addition, and during the Alpha alone, a lot of us went through the excitement of creating one or two, even when it was our first try at that kind of thing (and that's a good omen). The really gifted had already built awesome maps, so I think things will get *very* interesting from now concerning player-made-content.

Since it's an Early Access game, I won't go through a list of pros/cons or things like that (everything will evolve in the year to come), but I definitely recommend this game.
Even as it is today, it will interest any turn-based strategy player and help a lot a community and a style to go toward new horizons without betraying its glorious genealogy.";258.1;1.0;26.0;27.0;Posted: May 12

So...About the game. Played just one evening after job, as I used to play HoMM...what can I say about this game - Good...even better - Gorgeus.
Games graphics- 10/10. this art style is right on point. Such eye-pleasing act.
Good things about game:
1. Castle building and managment - very interesting aproach, quickly get used to it. It creates real micromanagment and allows you to specialise on specific units and upgrades you like. Wonderful.
2. Map design - every map I played so far feels really full.
3. Races - played only two so far, but they feel really authentic and yet familiar.
What I would like to see in future :
1. I would like to see in the end at least 4 more races
2. Some magic adjustment, because some spells (thorn barricades) are too chessy...I like cheese, but its too much in one spell.
3. More campaigns - at least 2 for each race, and with bit more lenght into it.

Why no negatives? Because its very good early acsess game and I believe...hope...this game will be great!!!
And one more - BIGGEST UPSIDE - self creating campaigns...10/10...all we needed. Endless potential! Great!";2.5;1.0;14.0;87.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I agree with the positive reviews about the homam feel, and pretty presentation, but it needs lot more time in the oven. Considering it costs 30E, I cannot recommend it at this state.

- It lacks depth. All systems are pretty shallow - building, economy, hero leveling
- Battles are not bad, but could use some more strategy - wait/defend options, obstacles blocking ranged attacks, more unit skills etc.
- Magic system is not great, spells are very unrewarding and lack impact - homam 3 system was way better imo
- Hard to see stuff on map, you constantly have to press alt to see what is pickable etc.
- Artifacts are really boring - looks cool, but only give bonus to stats, NO SPECIAL EFFECTS...
- Severe lack of QoLs - cant change keybindings, cant restart the fight if quick fight ends terribly, cant load from fight without having to leave to menu, no comparision of new item vs equiped and many more
- Unit cap - imo bad design or at least not very well balanced.
- Stuttering when moving camera on map - even with high fps it doesnt feel smooth.
- If you like cosmetic pets like I do - its only avaliable when you pay another 20E for supporter DLC...:/ Cant justify spending 50 on this.

Its nowhere near the quallity of homam 3 sadly. Devs look like a cool bunch and altough in current state it is imo not worth, I dont regret supporting the development and will happily revisit the review in the future.";15.8;0.0;22.0;101.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I will certainly play it after updates and update my review. 13h is not enough, I haven't even completed campaigns, 1 campaign mission and I went to skirmish.

Some of the stuff I write here is not like: mana was removed -> bad idea, I actually think that having couple of sources of mana is a brilliant idea but it has some flaws that can be improved upon. I understand it's not like HOMM and it shouldn't be, it's a different game and I don't want to play another HOMM with pixel graphics, so base mechanics are nice.

I want to recommend it but I want this to also get noticed by developers and they will most likely read bad reviews. So if you are reading this: the game overall is good, I understand it's EA, you have my support and a good review in the future because you have added some interesting things in the genre and I believe out of EA game will have enough content for it to become interesting to play more than once (right now it's kind of in a state where I want to play and see what the game has to offer and discover new things but I wouldn't play it for fun enjoying my time).

Things that I think are bad:

- Keeps loading forever when trying to attack a fully upgraded camp in skirmish.
- Troops placement could be done in arena, why do it before I wonder (maybe quick battle depends on it idk).
- I can't upgrade my troops if wielder is defending the camp, I have to get them out first, only then I can click to visit camp and upgrade them.
- Feels like AI has 10x money than me. Buying troops right and left and having 10 wielders that I have defeated and they keep coming even though I am like the strongest economy on the map.
- It lags when AI moves (maybe turn off animations during movements of AI).
- Battles need a lot of balancing (Nerf dmg, nerf ranged dmg by a lot).
- Base movement could be boosted by 1-2 points.
- Progression of camp is kind of slow with fast battles and how fast everything gets captured. Like I have already destroyed almost 2 enemies out of 4 and I haven't done even 1 research.
- It should tell you when you can build something and you try to skip a turn.
- (this one is like nice to have but not really counts in a review) Building UI should be more intuitive. Like -> enter build mode -> every place where you can build gets highlighted -> select what you want to build -> select a place.
- No line of sight for ranged units.
- Units could be more interesting, like have some kind of abilities where they shoot in a straight line or at random tiles, etc.
- Units could have more passive stuff, like being good vs some other units and bad vs another units (the review is -> strategy is lacking here).
- Artifacts definitely need some special bonuses, I have only found +offense +defense type of stuff. No stuff like -> a 10% chance your ranged unit of type yada yada will freeze enemy unit for 1 turn.
- Skills are boring, why wielders know all of the skills in advance? Very few abilities are available right now, EA maybe because of that.
- Skills are overpowered sometimes, like I took 3 ranged units and just used roots to prevent enemies from coming close to me and just annihilated them. Not using the old concept of scarce MANA was a bad idea, I can just spam all skills I want.
- It needs bigger maps, I don't know if technically possible but would be nice, the largest I have seen is 128.
- I haven't played for long enough to know if there are any quest givers and stuff alike in some buildings but I haven't seen it yet.
- It needs neutral mobs to be different sometimes, not affiliated with any faction, this adds more depth and changes strategy against fighting wielders vs fighting neutrals.
- I don't understand buffs that last 1 turn, that is ridiculous. A buff: ""+1 or +2 movement for 1 turn"", like what? Why did I even bother visiting and spending a move to get +1 or +2 move for 1 turn...
- No one reads the notifications on the right. Please hide them and make some toggle to open a log containing them.

There is lots of good stuff but I won't mention most of it since you can see it in the gameplay trailers.

- I love the idea where you can cast skills on multiple targets and multiple times on 1 target.";13.4;0.0;14.0;164.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have been waiting for so long to play this game. I was so lucky to be picked for alpha testing and I had a blast, everything is super polished, the pixel art looks amazing, the gameplay is all I hoped for and even my girlfriend complimented the music which she never does for other games I play.

Some random details you might find useful to know about the game:

Most importantly THERE IS HOTSEAT.
You don't get to build every building in every city, you only get access to so many plots of land in different sizes. So you have to strategize in advance, you can't just mindlessly throw down buildings.
Spells points are generated (mostly) during combat by the types of units your hero owns so if you have a lot of chaos units you will be able to cast a lot of chaos spells.
There's a full level editor and you can download ""songs"" (campaigns) that community members made.
Armies size capped, you get a maximum stack size which you can increase with research (There are 2 tech trees for each faction)

Those are the things I'd wanna know off the top of my head.

I hope there's big plans ahead for this game, mostly I'd wish for more factions, more spells, maybe some more ""daring"" items that do some crazy stuff, and a more complex skirmish system, that lets you customize the scenario more deeply.

Anyways thanks again to the amazing devs for the key, I highly recommend this game, it's boatloads of fun!";8.2;1.0;13.0;200.0;Posted: May 10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Waited for it since 1st announcement and this is major dissappointment for me as an HoMM, AoW & Disciples lover, here's why:
1. Combat - it's dumb. No wait, no positioning, almost none difference between units. Rangeв units are extremely overpowered.
2. Campaigns - they call 4 small missions a campaign. 1st campaign takes like 3-4hrs to complete with FULL SWEEP.
3. Hero progression - there is no skills like in HoMM. only very basic stats and level progression is just numbers. Nothing like hero specialization either. There is 1 in 8 levels ""power"" upgrade but those do nothing significant, being just numbers to different stats.
4. Map design - everythin is too free. Most of mines in campaign were not protected, lots and lots of stuff is free.
5. Town building - no special buildings, progression is very simple and not rewarding. Compare it to 1st time getting enough resources to build Black Dragon in HoMM 3. Even more wargame-like AoW has more interesting city-building.
6. Research - loved the concept, hate the execution. It's just simple numbers. That's it.

So right now it is so bare-bones so I don't recommend it. Given the fact developers consider it 2 campaigns complete I doubt those major design flaws would be fixed.

Some good things:
1. I've encountered 0 bugs.
2. Music is fine.
3. Art direction overall is great. (But wielders require lots of rework. They are very incostent between icons, models and what's displayed in cutscenes)
4. I like KIng's Bounty campaign style. Would like to see more emphasis on that.";4.0;0.0;17.0;1420.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TLDR; great to look at and listen to, odd to a veteran of the genre but through unfamiliarity rather than anything else! strange magic system and lacking in things i would like to see before i would consider supporting with my money. Keeping it on the radar!

I'm a Massive heroes fan, and I have played them all as they came out (yep i'm that old) so was super excited to see this ages ago and to wishlist it. I think my first impressions of this game are, it has huge potential and the graphics are quirky and quite lovely, it feels more like a take on Homm4 which i did like, with the limited stacks and funky building mechanics the igm is really nice and the atmosphere is pretty compelling but I did not in my small time playing get on with the ""magic"" system which uses coloured orbs generated by the troops under your command.

I played through the first campaign mission and a small map against AI. The AI punished me hard for not getting the build order right but that is on me, Also the auto-battles are atrocious as is a mainstay in the homm games so no surprises there, i lost a rather large army in my small map playthrough against an ""easy"" stack because of that, so maybe it was just tough luck but i will tell it as i saw it.

I found the ""tactics"" phase of battles a little janky with random spots for unit placement being a bit offputting but that could be down to my weak hero not having the right skillset, and not having the tactics ability though in that case i would rather skip the phase entirely and just get plopped randomly as there is not much you can do to effect the battle in the unleveled state.
the inclusion of height on the landscape during battles i think was unique to homm4 and i was glad to see it here, think a little like endless legends and something i enjoyed and hope finds its way into the genre as a staple.

The deal breakers for me were the building and the lack of random maps.

I thought the building was cool looking having it on the map and not having to go into a separate screen. but there is no feedback as to what to build and how to get better stuff! i managed to get a large building plot with a research building on it and a couple of other bits in my main town before the AI came and curb stomped me but i couldn't figure out how to upgrade troops or anything close to a build order, maybe i should have had another go with AI turned off. but i was fearing the refund window so didn't get around to it but first impressions of it were confusing and even though it was unique amongst these kind of games hard to get to grips with and considering the amount of games like this i have played over the years it should almost be second nature to me...

One of the huge replay-ability points for me in these kinds of games is the ability to make a random map and just hot-seat with the family and crush some AI or each other, But that feature is lacking in here as of time of writing.

I think i will hold off on this even though it is compelling and a really gorgeous looking game, the pixel art looks at home in this style of game and i would love to see expansions and more to add to the game (especially in the random maps department) i will probably get it again in 6 months time depending on the dev's. though if coffee stain are publishing it and making the dev's support it like they do with satisfactory then i will be all in soon enough but refunded for now! thanks for reading";0.9;0.0;74.0;1215.0;Posted: May 10

I want to start by saying that I love the art design, and I think this game has great potential; however, as it is right now, I cannot recommend this game unless you are excited to support the development.

The strategy is shallow -- there just aren't a lot of choices given to the player. The primary gameplay loop is: 1) collect shiny things on the map, 2) attack enemies that aren't stronger than you, 3) repeat. I wish the locations on the map offered more interesting dilemmas and/or sidequests. I wish the units had their own abilities, or that there were branching upgrades to them. I wish the spell system offered more interesting spells than ""hurt them a little"", or ""speed up this unit a little.""

Once you figure out a winning build, there's no real reason to explore beyond it, and the matches are over before you get the opportunity to really feel like it's ""your"" kingdom.";4.4;0.0;20.0;58.0;Posted: May 12

Songs of Conquest is a turn-based strategy RPG that is heavily influenced by the Heroes of Might and Magic series, but is packed full of it's own flavor and personality. There are so many noticeable quality of life additions to the gameplay formula. If you like the HoMM series, then I can safely say this game is for you - even the hotkeys are similar. Now if you are not a HoMM gamer, then this game will be a sweet little treat that will introduce you to one of the best niche game genres. It's easy to become immersed into Songs of Conquest because of the soundtrack and the beauty of the hand drawn pixel graphics. I usually don't care for pixel graphics, but this is quality.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Beautiful graphics and lovely music. But the rest is just meh. Diversity in enemy types, items, points of interest or spells is very low. It's all very generic and boring. Never was excited about anything I found.

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad either. But just okay turns out to be a sleeping pill or sometimes even tedious.

Some new approaches to old mechanics were made. Like instead of having mana and discovering spells (which is very exciting) you have all spells from the beginning and your troop variations define what spells you can use.

It seems a lot of people like that approach. For me it's just very boring. Plus you're forced to do some combinations that you don't really want.

Not many bugs. Some obviously, but it's Early Access after all. In general quite polished. Which is also why I doubt that much of the things that I don't like will be changed. So for me there are better alternatives, and the King: HOMM3 is still unbeaten.

I can't recommend it. Which is a shame, because I certainly can see the love that the devs put into the game. Maybe Workshop and Random Map generator will lift this up. It certainly could be something amazing with some medium tweaks.";3.4;0.0;16.0;290.0;Posted: May 12

I am always judging a game for what I pay.
I am a big fan of this kind of game (Homm style).
But I cannot recommend this game for this price.

Got only 5 hours and I am already bored. Did the 2 campaign.
PRO :
+ The game is pretty, nice style
+ Nostalgia ; this is pretty much what make this game good. Like starwars, all the new movies are ♥♥♥♥♥, but people just remember the golden age.

CONS :
- The battle is all about the biggest army and going all in. Just stack armies, use all your spell and pray you will do enough damage before the enemy.
- Defence is useless. Stack as much offence as you can and try to one shot everything you can before they do you any damage. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ system.
- You want to win, stack an army with a lot of mobility, initiative and go all in.
- Range is broken. You cannot hide behind any obstacles to boost your defence. Range no have any line of sight, so they can just shoot you from every angles even if you got 3 big defender in front of your archer.
- There is no strategies (or maybe a little). Just go all in.

Overall : Nostalgia based game. No point to play at this price.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL;DR : beautiful graphics, few subtleties of gameplay, lack of content, and exagerated price tag. Come back when the early access is finished and buy it on sale

As a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and strategic RPGs in general, I really wanted to like this game. And to some extent I do : it has a beautiful pixel art with an efficient hud and controls, and it successfully implements the core gameplay of the game it drew inspiration from. But I'm not satisfied with it and I'll try to explain why.

For instance, wielder magic, leveling and inventory systems are less interesting than in HOMM2, since most of the bonuses each system provides are basic stats that makes you stronger without making any build stand out. Similarly, military units and buildings are actually not that varied and quite conventional in their design, at least for the Stoutheart faction I played.

Since the gameplay is not that varied, the clear lack of content becomes a major issue, and simply adding the 2 missing campaigns will not cut it. For now, there are 2 campaigns available, which can be finished in 3 to 4 hours each, and there is a skirmish mode in player vs player or AI, as well as a map editor. I'm sure the community will create relevant content, but I really expect more from the developers.

Combined with the AA price tag, this lack of content is what makes me leave a negative review. I do realize that this is an early access game and I truly wish to come back to it one day and change my review, but I simply believe it should cost twice less and offer four times more content. The gameplay part may be more complicated to improve but I'm sure it's possible. It can still become a great game.";2.0;0.0;14.0;61.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Wish i could give this a neutral rating, it's a good game marred by very confusing design decisions clearly influenced by certain individuals in the discord and the lack of experience from the developers/maybe they have an ego. I am a massive HOMM fan and its very disappointing to see this game go two steps forward in one direction and three steps backwards in another

The positives:


+ Beautiful art style

+ Sorely needed entry in the Genre, although we are yet to see a game better than HOMM 3 which is just insane as its 20 years old

+ Very strong design of the distinct factions

+ Good sound and visual effects

+ Music is decent but still nothing as good as Paul Anthony Romero has made, the man loves doing homm work so its a mystery as to why he was not hired

The Negatives

- Confusing and pointless spell system, they could have stuck to a standard mana pool but decided to be unique and it feels very strange

- Bland UI which contradicts with the next point

- Too much clutter on the screen, why make a boring UI if its hard to see whats happening in the first place? There are so many shiny objects covering the screen its very hard to spot what's important

- Lack of basic features such as unit cards, hard to access combat log, no town screen (Why on earth did you skip this as supposed HOMM fans?)

- Very hard to tell what the power level of a unit will be for a beginner. Part of why HOMM was so popular is it was easy to learn and even a small child could figure out that a dragon will eat a skeleton without much trouble. In this game most units are similiar sized and even the large ones sometimes end up being on the weaker side compared to others. It is not clear who will win a fight at a glance (This could also be somewhat remedied with a unit card)

- Very unbalanced units compared to the economy, seems to be designed without enough thought which also relates to the next point

- The AI is stupid and blatantly cheats. It seems to have either a massive resource bonus or flat out infinite resources, if you play the campaign you will clearly notice this problem. You can decimate a doom stack and then have another appear out of thin air at the enemy settlement when you will be unable to buy most units even with full map control. This cheapens the entire experience and seems insanely lazy. This also leads to the campaign being a save scum Slogfest. Giving the AI infinite ♥♥♥♥ is not a good solution to an easy campaign

- Bugs and lag are everywhere, i am sorry but a pixel art game has no right to lag this much at times. You are telling me i can run cyberpunk fine but i have problems in SoC when i press end turn?

- The price for the content given. 30e is premium for an early access title with so many issues. There are only 4 factions in the game, homm 3 (with expansions) has 9. I expect this game to get stale very quickly


It remains to be seen whether or not the developers will actually fix anything or just listen to the fanboys too scared to give any criticism on their discord, i would not purchase this game in its current state unless you are a die hard fan of the genre like me.

To me it seems like the developers refused obviously good design to put forward something 'unique'. If the formula isn't broke you dont need to fix it, there's a reason all cars use wheels instead of tank tracks

A random set of pros/cons as they come to my mind. I'm going to update the review as I play more and reflect on the game.

Pros:
- City management is unique and fresh. Initially I thought that it won't be that fun, but actually it's quite challenging and requires you to specialize cities/towns.
- I like Rally Point building that allows you to recruit units from other towns. It's handy and doesn't waste your time with creating delivery chains.
- Maps are rich and interactive, a lot of objects, a lot of resources/treasures. It feels rewarding.
- Strategic resources are unique and I can easily tell one from another.
- Visually game is very impressive. It creates that ""magic"" feeling that a lot of homm-like games usually miss.
- Battles are difficult and it's pretty hard to get through a battle with no losses.
- I actually like stack limits, it adds more challenge to the game and kind of represents hero's command ability.

Cons:
- I don't like when it's raining on strategic map, it makes everything harder to see and identify.
- I don't quite like that there's no ""wait"" or ""defend"" option in the battle.
- Games feel a bit short, I finish a standard map before I can fully upgrade my line-up and do research.
- No random map generator, but I think it's because it early access.

Overall a very good game, I can see that the developers are passioned about what they are doing.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Songs of Conquest is a pretty decent light version of Heroes of Might and magic with pixel graphics, with one glaring difference that completely ruins combat (and thus, the entire game) as it currently stands in early access.

The magic system is entirely broken. If you go into combat with an AI wizard that is at all leveled up they will, for the most part, delete your army before you get a chance to do anything. Rapid firing spells one after the other, all on one turn, that do massive damage. I'm sure it's possible to make a similar character as a player, but that brings the combat down to ""who has the fastest unit"" which again, is not a fun game and basically invalidates military characters and units.

The music has a very good ambient feel but nothing really strikes me as being special, which is fine. The unit depth is similarly good but not great. There just aren't that many units to play with except for the undead faction which has way more for some reason. I assume this is an early access issue. The graphics, while pixel art is not my personal favorite, are very well done, and they mix in some great effects that make the game look better than the screenshots might suggest.

It's just so unfortunate that the magic system basically makes everything else irrelevant. If they can fix it the game will be a solid if not spectacular HOMM like. If they can't then it is simply unplayable. For now, I don't recommend purchasing it. If it gets fixed, then certainly I will update my review.";9.6;0.0;11.0;420.0;Posted: May 13

Totally not heroes of might and magic. Great art (both pixels and portraits etc). There is some part of the campaign already. You can also do skirmishes and has a multiplayer option. Seems like a very nice start to the early access.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Good points:
- Magic system: When each army units take a turn, it generates mana of a certain color, you store it and use it to cast spells. -> No super spell at the beginning of the battle -> You can fling spells around if you store the mana
- Army stack size cap: Think king's bounty here. -> Straightforward to have several heroes
- City building: There are certain slots of different sizes available -> different settlements for different purposes

Bad point:
Uninspired Artifacts, hero skills and research design (even spells to a certain extent): It's all +10/20/30 to attack or defense stat... It makes for a very bland, unexciting gameplay rather than offer build options to diversify playstyle.
Example: Basic sword and board foot soldier. The shield reduces range attack damage by 50%. Research options: +10/20/30 defense per level of research. Suggestion: +10% range attack damage reduction (50 to 60%) -> +10% attack of opportunity damage -> +1 movement range";1.3;0.0;16.0;123.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Spent a bit over a 1/2 hour with the game going through the first campaign mission and main this game gushes great old school gaming vibes. I had zero bugs with the game and it ran beautifully. The game play is great and for most turn based strategy game fans you will be able to jump right in without any issues. I can't wait to see the finished product. I usually don't listen to the soundtrack, but I might have to turn this one on because the ending of the first campaign mission had a great catching tune that is a lot like Toss a Coin to Your Witcher. The game animations are great, the the sound effects are great as well. The story seems very interesting so far as well. So even though I haven't given it a full hour of game play yet, I highly recommend it. No wonder so many of my Steam friends are jumping to buy this game or have wishlisted it. It deserves it. As for the asking price, it is worth $30 USD if the developers continue and do release a finished product which I have no reason to believe they will not. Also this game has a great open-ended extension ability via ongoing DLC packs for different races/etc. So I think this game will have a pretty swell future ahead of it.";0.6;1.0;13.0;1515.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
For everyone who hopes this game to be another Heroes of Might and Magic 3 I have good news - this actually is another Heroes of Might and Magic game! Literally. When I played it I had the feeling that if you gave the same task of ""pls make Heroes 3"" to two different teams, then Songs of Conquest could be the alternative pixel-art Heroes 3 we never had. Until now. So...
Is it a modern game filled with novelties and originality?
Is it a nostalgic, really beautiful alternative Heroes 3 game we actually want?

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Is it HoMM (Heroes Of Might And Magic) reborn?

In short? Yes, yes it is, and as someone who spent years playing hotseat games with friends and family as well as daylong matches on MSN gamezone (Yeah, member that?) I couldn't be happier with how closely this game replicates that feeling.

There's some differences of course:

- Town management is handled and reflected on the map and not on a separate screen
- There's unit troop limits for both how many troop stacks you can have as well as the numbers of units in said stacks (These can be upgraded via wielder level up skills and research upgrades respectively)
- Capturing cities converts all the buildings and units to YOUR faction

And that's just to start!

Ok but what about the factions?

There's 4 factions:
- The Arleon, your standard human soldiers, knights, archers...but what a twist! You get giant Satyrs and Faye creatures!

- The Barya Mercenaries, The desert themed nomad variety, traps, spears, hyenas!

- The Barony Of Loth (My personal favorite), The undead, poisonous rats, plague doctors with hand crossbows, giant flaming spirit armors!

- The Rana, Swamp creatures, Frogs, poison slinging spellcaster shaman....and DRAGONS!

They each have their own cosmetic flavor to their cities, BGM, victory fanfares, etc, it's all very detailed!


Well if you're familiar with HoMM then you're already going to feel right at home, it's the same map traversal, lots of collectible resources for your city, gear for your wielder, troops, encounters with neutral enemies and camps.

And the maps themselves are very detailed, lots of foliage and particle effects and it can be overwhelming to see everything at times (Protip: Hold alt to have important things highlighted for you!)

The combat takes place on a hex grid, units have their own movement range, attack ranges, etc. It's all turn based and effected by various stats like initiative, and terrain height is also very important!

All wielders (The commanders you control) can use magic each turn during combat, but the difference between this game and HoMM is your units have their own elemental values that get added to a pool each round which gives you access to various spells for damage, buffs, debuffs, traps, and obstacles.


Well, it's currently in early access. There's two campaigns which are currently rather short, 4 stages each, I personally hope they're expanded and possibly add campaigns for the other two factions.

There's also a skirmish mode that lets you choose a map and up to 5 AI (6 players total) depending on the map size.

Also included is multiplayer, a map editor, custom campaigns from the community too!

From what I've read the devs are planning a Random Map Generator for skirmish which is a much requested feature from people like me, we'll have to wait and see!


Well, there's just a lot of minor things I'd want:
- Better UI for garrisoning my troops at a base or adding them to my army, it's kinda clunky.

- A method for teleporting between bases, air travel, or underground travel like HoMM had, which could add more content on every map and add shortcuts to get back to base quicker.

That's just to start, a lot of my other needs would be fulfilled by simply having the random map generator so that every match feels fresh and I don't already know where everything is.


Personally I haven't experienced anything that I would normally expect from early access games, the load times are fast even on a HDD, the framerate remains stable at max settings (144 fps/1440p) with only minor stutters moving the camera when the map is fully uncovered.

Only a couple of weird bugs, like not being able to switch factions on other skirmish maps besides the basic one it starts you on, but I've found a way around that. And I've had a large building that I made just suddenly vanish and isn't able to be interacted with, but it's definitely still there and you can recruit from your base as normal, after a few turns it comes back and is visible.


Definitely! I know turn based games are a dying breed, as are the people who get into them but I think if you give it a chance you might enjoy it! And if you're already a fan of games like HoMM, king's bounty, disciples, etc then you REALLY should give this game a try.

The artwork, the animations on the unit sprites, the atmosphere, it's all very rich and vibrant.

My time with it at the time of writing this isn't that long, I'll admit, but I've gone through 1 of the two campaigns and won a couple skirmishes at medium difficulty with 3 of the 4 factions, since the maps don't change I feel like I can evaluate it reasonably enough.

If anything comes up, I'll definitely update this review. And there's still the necessity of re-evaluating it once it's fully launched!

The devs seem to be very active with the community and are open to feedback, even offering to sit in on people's twitch streams and discuss the game with them, and their community discord is VERY populated, that all looks promising for the future of a game that can only get better with a strong community and devs who support it.


Yeah sorry, I'm not used to this sort of thing. But I wanted to express my thoughts and since I don't stream on twitch anymore (Just discord with my friends) I felt it was worth trying to give any sort of feedback I can, whether that helps you the reader or the devs I can only hope.

I love this game so far, and I hope the community grows so we can love it as much as people loved HoMM!";7.5;1.0;6.0;312.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It should go without saying with my playtime, but these are first impressions. I wanted to stay in the refund window (and I did get a refund), which might be all you need to know. I've done the ""tutorial"" campaign map, which taught me next to nothing minus some forgettable lore via an unlikable main character, and a skirmish map.

SOC is a very limited HOMM-alike. Compared to others in the genre: HOMM 1-5, Age of Wonders 1-3, King's Bounty: Armored Princess, Fallen Enchantress, Disciples: Liberation, Hero's Hour... all managed to grab me in the first hour far better than SOC. And if we expand that to just fantasy turn-based strategy combat in general, the list gets way wider.

I'd put SOC near or a little below Heroes 6:

It's pretty in screenshots. Less so in motion. It's in blocky pixel art, 2.5d for some reason, lathered in shaders because it's Unity and why not, and the graphics are often dark and muddy - which makes some adventure sites hard to see. Luckily you can hold ALT to see all of them itemized out like loot piles from an ARPG. It also uses way too many resources for what you get, again, because it's Unity. Laptop users can expect a toasty lap for something that's less attractive and readable than Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic from 2005.

Music is... present? Inoffensive? I haven't heard anything memorable.

The magic just isn't there - both figuratively and literally. Figuratively, the UI is cold, utilitarian, and lacks character - it reminds me of Endless Legend, which also struggled with finding its voice. Adventure map objects have little blurbs like from HOMM, but, like Endless Legend, you really only get a cryptic one-liner and then a stat spitout of what the object did. The objects don't tell a story. I'm not sure if it's trying to be sparse and grimdark or whether it's just uninspired.

Literally, the magic isn't there because magic is really, really boring.

SoC tries something new with mana by tying it to the number of stacks and what types of units you have in your army. I don't know why - maybe to strike a difference between a strong fighting army versus a strong casting army? Maybe so magic is a big part of every fight and not just with Magic heroes? Anyway, it's not particularly interesting because the spells themselves aren't particularly interesting. +5 Defense for a turn. Yay? +1 Movement and +1 Initiative for a turn. Ok? -25% damage to a unit for a turn. Cool?

Damage spells are pathetic and I haven't seen any way to boost them. A Fireball that requires 9 mana to kill three tier 1 troops? I'll just stack ranged armies in the game that has no Wait command, no Defend command, and no cover system, thanks.

Oh yeah. There's no Wait, no Defend, and no cover system, so it's a ranged unit paradise. They can even shoot after moving, albeit with a penalty! Apparently this was to make fights faster or something? There is, however, zone of control and attacks of opportunity to make sure you can protect those ranged units. Because building a little bunker your ranged shredders will fire from isn't slow, apparently.

Now the bad: there are only four towns. This puts the game on par with HOMM. No, not the series - the very first game. Actually it's worse: HOMM1 had neutral units like Rogues and Ghosts. There are no neutral units in SoC. There's no penalty for mixing units of different factions though - because you can't use units of other factions. You also can't sail on water in SoC, another feature that was present 27 years ago in HOMM1. There's no random map generator either - something HOMM1 had in its Win95 release and HOMM2 had in its initial release.

Apparently this has been in development for five years. If they've only managed to reach feature parity with a game from 1995, and not even parity with one from 1996, it doesn't bode too well for the future.

Sadly I think this is another case where faffing about with graphics was prioritized over just making a game that's fun to play. 2.5d brings nothing to the game and if anything often makes it harder to read at a glance from an isometric perspective.";1.0;0.0;18.0;778.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
SHUT UP AND TAKE MORE OF MY MONEY!!!

Yes, I have alpha tested this game for months offering a lot of feedback as I have played probably ever strategy game you can name released starting with the gran-daddy of them all DUNE II, so It appears as a nice nod they gave me the product for free.

HOWEVER THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC.

I make a decent living and when I tell you I'm about to buy this for around 6-10 of my friends in both real life and just through the web it is no idle boast... I WANT that many fans of just damn good games, especially strategy games, to get their hands on this.

WHAT IS IT LIKE?

If you have EVER even REMOTELY enjoy a game like heroes of might and magic, a turned based strategy game, or strategy games in general you will absolutely enjoy this game. That's all I really need to say, and as a matter of fact, it IS all I'm going to say, as I have some purchasing to do and can't wait to absolutely REVEL in sharing the pure ""kid on christmas"" excitement and joy this game gives the player with friends and for both myself.

Every day some indie company releases some half baked project into Early Access on steam, but getting an absolute working, downright piece of art GEM of a game? Hell that's rare period.

THIS IS THAT GEM.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
There are several reasons that I want to like this game, but ultimately Songs of Conquest is Checkers to the strategy genre's Chess. Player choice is scarce, and as a result strategy is pre-defined. The worst thing a strategy game can do is feel linear, and SoC is as linear as they come.

There's virtually never a time where you have more than one option for how to approach a given situation, you'll build the same buildings in the same order every map. There are far fewer units available than in a game like HOM&M and each of them has fewer passive skills and unique characteristics. There are no branching unit upgrade paths or units with situational tactical abilities, so unit deployment and what you actually do on each one of their turns has no influence on the outcome of a battle - because there's only one thing they can do. There are dozens of spells that all do the same things (generic offense/defense buffs or debuffs) but with various targeting methods or power levels.

The end result is that Songs of Conquest feels incredibly shallow. It's in EA and it has the potential to be something neat if it reassesses some of its design philosophy, but right now it's more on the Minimum Viable Product side of EA launches and does not stand up well as an actual videogame.";1.0;0.0;18.0;939.0;Posted: May 12

An Glorious and Fun TBS Game

Songs of Conquest is a great game because the combat feels smooth and interesting. The four factions are very different and interesting since they are not your average generic fantasy factions. The Spells and Essence System is easy to understand and allowed interesting builds based on the composition of your armies. Finally, the art, animations, and music are phenomenal and appealing to me since the Pixel art and their animations are easy to read and fun to look at. I definitely love this game and it have potential to be one of the greats of strategy gaming. Also I did not grow up with Heroes of Might and Magic so I was able to appreciate the craftsmanship and quality of Songs of Conquest greatly.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As someone not familiar with the common comparison of HOMM, the game at first from trailers and whatnot came across as being a 4x game with a lot less depth but in a more 'streamlined' manner, and while the intuitive UI and easy game controls did fulfill the streamlined aspect, the game definitely doesn't sacrifice depth to achieve that, which is so awesome.

I was so happy to finish the first mission of the campaign, not sure if the game will hold my attention for long, and then switch to 1v1'ing my friend on the smallest island map and getting an hour into the game feeling like we weren't even halfway done. It does a great job of making you feel the transition from one guy in a hut into a great empire in a satisfying way that doesn't stagnate in weird places.

If I were to have any criticism if you could call it that, is I feel like for this game to truly have longevity it will need to put more focus into expanding races, adding new ones, and fully fleshing out the multiplayer, because while I absolutely find myself getting lost in the amazing art and world, the campaign fell short and I wasn't too interested in the 'reward songs'.

Game is great as is, add in things such as roster expansions, whole new factions, and multiplayer support, and we have a real long term gem. Good job guys.";11.8;1.0;4.0;207.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've been mulling over the merits of this game for a bit in my head and couldn't quite place my thoughts in order until I read some reviews to get others' opinions.

The part of other peoples' comments that clicked most with me was the magic system. While playing, I didn't really understand the magic system. That's because it is purposely obtuse for no good reason. It seems to me they changed it simply because they realized the rest of the game (except the city building aspect) was a lesser beat for beat remake of any Heroes of Might and Magic-like game to have existed. They felt the need to ""spice things up"". So they changed and castrated the ""magic"" part of Might & Magic. This essence nonsense not only isn't fun, it's limp-wristed and a numbers game. Further, it doesn't make any sense. Why do Wielders get their powers from the troops under their command? I suppose any half-way decent writer could come up with a mystical excuse, but it's still stupid. Even more so from a gameplay perspective, because it implies that the Wielder isn't a real character, but an amalgamation of their troops. In fact, that is a further problem I have with the game, the Wielders don't feel interesting or powerful. They don't - feel - like they're in command. The army just exists to smash into another army, and the Wielder is just their mascot.

Another thing that others have touched on was something I didn't even notice. The lack of overworld magic. That's huge for a game like this. A large part of the strategy in these types of games was the magic you used in the overworld, to buff your army, or hinder your enemies. Now this is just... gone? And that's an improvement?

So much for the ""magic"" part. Now let us speak briefly about the ""might"". It's... here. It's not really interesting either. You have stacks of units that do things and toss them at other stacks of units that do things. None of the units seem very interesting. Some are downright bad (Militia) and some do quite well (any undead unit). Many have said the battle maps are too small. I tend to agree. The maps are a bit smallish and the engagements are very quick. The terrain isn't interesting, you generally have flat ground and you have high ground. Not much else. I will say one thing I very much do not like about the ""might"" system is the stack caps. This, again, is a balancing ""fix"" to the formula. All units now have a cap on their stack size, which is very off putting to me. The whole allure to this type of genre is that it abstracted battles but still gave you the illusion that you were in command of a mighty force. In Heroes games you could have thousands upon thousands of troops under your generals. Each unit could represent many thousands of soldiers. Each bit of a damage to that unit was dozens, if not hundreds, of people dying each blow. Now? Eh... 50ish units per stack. Can be increased some more via research. What? Even Disciples games did a better job at creating an illusionary battlefield with it's four units than this. Because somehow, Disciples battles, while quick and streamlined like this game, were more compelling than the battles here.

The game overall itself is serviceable. The graphics, for the style they were going for (pixel art) is fairly attractive... except for the horrific slo-mo close-up shots of the final hit in a battle. These can be turned off, thankfully. The music is fine, but nothing outstanding. The overall pace of the game is steady and a good homage to Heroes games. The city building is actually something I do like, though I do wish it was somewhat less restrictive. The fact your city exists on the map instead of a separate ""city screen"" is a nice change. The game is a safe, by the numbers tribute to the Heroes games. If that's what you're looking for, you'll enjoy it... for a time.

I'll admit, I never played Heroes of Might and Magic 3 - the supposed gold standard of this genre. I have played 4, 5, 6, the Disciples games, and a lot of ""clones"" in my time and I enjoy the format. Though I think the problem is that it has grown very stagnant and a lot of people are trying to basically reinvent the wheel instead of inventing the automobile. I feel this game is good, but plays it safe and tries to ""balance"" the game; which always means to dumb it down and strip things out.

I feel I gave this game too much leeway in trying to see the good and ignore the bad. As such, I have crept past the two hour refund window and have to eat the rather somewhat steep price for what's on offer. I'd caution anyone else to wait and see how the EA develops, but even then I think the fundamentals here are just too safe for a hallmark game; but just another Heroes of Might and Magic wannabe that is a flash in the pan and may even be forgotten within a year.

As I said before, if you're desperate for a Heroes-like game, you'll find a decent one here. It takes many of the right ques from that storied genre and does them quite well (magic, notwithstanding). But ultimately, the question I ask myself and you should do as well, ""Is there any reason to play this over those old games you probably already own?"" My answer would be flatly, no. And despite all the work gone into this game and the nice little pixel art on display, that is the most damning verdict of all.

If you're looking for a Heroes-like game that has poor modern day graphics but fantastic gameplay and an actual creative approach to moving the genre forward, I suggest you skip this game and take a look at the Conquest of Elysium series.";9.9;0.0;10.0;325.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This Early Access game is a really well made product.

- Great soundtrack, graphics and style work perfectly
- The UI is really intuitive and fairly simple but has good tool-tips for more detail
- Well thought out races x4 and a fairly simple economy that works (as in you never quite have all the resources you want or need)

It deserves a thumbs up review... but there are a few downsides and issues.

It is a little shallow on actual content for the price though at this stage - Only 4 races. Certain stuff like the magic system and battlefields feel a bit too compressed - magic is really ineffective and although they have tried to innovate (taking a bit from Age of Wonders mixing magic schools) - in reality the magic is underwhelming and a bit redundant in comparison to HoMM in part because by turn 2 everything is in melee anyway.

It also suffers some legacy issues exactly like HoMM - for example splitting your unit stack into single units is still overpowered - taking a whole AI stack's damage and providing a turn as a buffer. The AI also sadly cheats on economy and is very basic. There's no diplomacy or deeper interaction with the AI and so...

The mid-game feels a bit dull in terms of once an area is cleared of loot, monsters etc the game just becomes a bit tedious - it would be great if they had more POI (points of interest) that you could grow and develop over the duration of the game - stuff that gives 'economy' wielders something to do instead of all charging for enemy towns or beacons just to end the game and 'win' ASAP. Something like an artefact workshop where a wielder can stand for a few turns to make or upgrade items seems a logical and technically simple leap.

Another issue is the devs appear slightly non-committal on future content from what I've read. I understand not wanting to disappoint people or get hopes up too much, but at the same time the premium price (for EA at least) does warrant quite a bit more content ... promised and ideally delivered IMHO. Relying on modders to pad out the game for them for free would be a mistake for me, especially since everything is just so well crafted and polished thus far.

Overall I'd give it an: 7.5 out of 10
Very solid foundations but needs (and I expect it to be) expanded upon.";12.5;1.0;4.0;96.0;Posted: May 14

TL;DR - This game is enjoyable enough for a full release, not just Early Access. There are only 4 factions and a limited number of official maps. , the factions are nicely varied and there is a really good map editor with mod.io integration so you can download community maps easily.

You can grow your cities and armies however you like. Do you want to spam a single unit? You can do that. Would you rather have every unit available for your faction? Also possible! Cities do have different maximum sizes (limiting how many buildings you can make) and armies have a limit for how many units you can have in a stack. This prevents deathballs and putting all units into a single army and works just fine.

There is some limited research, which lets you buff your units, heroes (wielders), economy, and unit limit for a single stack.

Magic is interesting. Your heroes can natively generate a bit of essence (like mana but in 5 different flavors) but most of essence is given to you by your own units. Every time a unit takes its turn, you get a bit more essence. The longer a battle lasts, the more powerful spells you can cast. You can gain more magic faster by spreading your army wide. by doing so you take greater risk, because every time a stack is destroyed, an enemy army gains a stacking buff. It's a nice balance of risk&reward.

The AI is a bit lacking. It does better on maps with a lot of cities but makes some questionable choices on the battlefield. Currently, there's only an easy and medium AI available, though both are quite easy. However, you can also play this game in hot seat or online.
Pro tip - . This will let you set up teams and play team games.

In general, a great game with a few minor issues, I had a ton of fun already, and I can't wait to find out what's coming in the future.";87.1;1.0;3.0;265.0;Posted: May 10

I was really looking forward for this game and so far I am not disappointed! In my opinion, any HOMAM fan would love this :)

EDIT:
What I like:
- gorgeous and colorful graphics
- city building
- good UI

What I don't like:
- battles are basically about each side rushing to other side, there's not really much strategy in them
- capped units (max 20 archers per stack, etc.)
- spells are not really exciting to use, just meh...most of the time you don't even say to yourself: ""ah, lets's use a spell""
- unit placement before combat (random tiles are picked and you can place your units there)";6.0;1.0;3.0;246.0;Posted: May 10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Is Songs of Conquest Adventure Worthy?

Yes, yes it is. Songs of Conquest is the perfect spiritual successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic series. It has fantastic '2.5d' pixel art, in-depth turn-based strategy, many RPG elements, a gripping story campaign, and even a built in level editor, skirmish mode and multiplayer, too, which I have yet to spend a whole lot of time with but will be checking out soon. I've had an absolute blast playing the game thus far and can't wait for more!

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Song of Conquest is a exceptional turn bases trategy game that emulates games such in vein of the Heroes of Might and Magic era (Before the game became ♥♥♥♥ do to ubisoft.) adding some cool twists ideas on the use of how using spells and abilities works, the usefulness of units so on and so forth. this game is phenomenal there is still a good deal of things to be done for balancing. there's a lot of combos and ways to run armies and wielders and more will be discussed / improved upon as the Early access continues but for now for 30$ this game gives you more than enough bang for your buck. the story is well written, you have interesting characters and challenging levels for the campaign setting and for multiplayer this can go up to 8 players total. leading to some fun interesting and intense games. if you lvoe turn based strategy games and enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic this game is definitly worth looking into and possibly picking up.";31.7;1.0;4.0;110.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's a nice game but I have the feeling AI is cheating. First 3 mission in the first campaign are not all that difficult. 3 mission might take some trial and error but it's do-able. The 4th mission however is a whole different story.

It starts out okay and with a lot of care you can defeat the first enemy wielder you meet after that it's all downhill.
You only have 3 wielders, the enemy has 4.
Whenever an enemy wielder is killed they get ressed with massive amounts of troops.
I can not make enough troops / have enough gold to keep my 3 wielders fully stacked with troops at all times.
I do not have enough gold to buy units at the neutral buildings.
I can not protect my villages with the amount of wielders / resources I have.

Maybe i need to rush more? I don't know, I can't seem to figure it out.
Or maybe I'm not good enough to play this game but at the moment there seems to be no way to reduce the difficulty as far as I know.

It's fun up to a certain point for me and that's why I cant recommend the game at this point.";9.4;0.0;4.0;168.0;Posted: May 14

This game reminds of Heroes of Might and Magic but in its current state it fails to be a worthy successor.

I would give a neutral thumb if it was possible.

good: the art and sound
it makes some things better than hereos

bad: some ui decissions are really wicked, making it more unintuitive as it has to bee
the map feels cluttered with stuff, but most gives just small bonuses
lacks the skills and units of heroes of m&m
you are tied to the factiontroops which limits the already low different units";5.8;0.0;9.0;239.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, as someone who's been playing HoMM games since heroes 2 came out in 1996 and would consider them formative childhood games, I think that Songs of Conquest is actually better, overall. A lot of thought has gone into fixing a lot of old issues, which manifests in redesigned systems like essences, stack limits, and so on. The artstyle is quite good, albeit a little pixelated at times when zoomed in, but still good. Music is top-notch, on par or better than the tracks from the HoMM games, in my opinion. Playing the first campaign ended up keeping me up till 7am and I only noticed when I wondered why my head is starting to hurt, so I'm just gonna go ahead and call the gameplay aspect very, very good.";16.2;1.0;3.0;618.0;Posted: May 11

I never really got into HoMM even though i tried, they were just a bit too old for my taste yet i knew this was a kind of game i could really enjoy. Songs of Conquest makes things right by modernizing a bit the genre enough to appeal for veteran of HoMM-like or younger strategic/tactic enthousiast like me. Add to that the prettiest pixel art I've seen, a surprisingly good and deep lore waiting to be develloped more as more campaigns will be added through the EA; And finally a solid soundtrack that without standing out too much while you play, will perfectly accompany you through your adventures (I sometimes listen to it while working or reading).";16.8;1.0;3.0;277.0;Posted: May 12

As a long time fan of the heroes of might and magic franchise, this has been on my radar for some time. In recent years the Heroes formula has grown a bit stale, especially with games such as Age of Wonders 3 that really have a lot more angles, but Songs of Conquest has a lot of new takes on the mechanics keeping the best and iterating on what needs updating.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I was a huge fan of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 back in the day. I had all the expansions, and when I wasn't playing every single map I was making my own in the map editor. When Songs of Conquest was announced at E3 2019 I was so unbelievably excited that Lavapotion was inspired by the HoMM experience and were potentially going to set things straight after the series unfortunately took more and more steps away from what made it great.

I jumped into Songs of Conquest hoping to find that same spark and it absolutely delivers. It surpasses everything I wanted out of the game. It has enough for fans of the original HoMM games to get nostalgic about, but it has just the right changes to make it its own. I love building my town on the map, the slow motion death animation of the final enemy unit, and the unexpected variety of units.

It surpasses everything I wanted and I could not be happier with this game.";6.9;1.0;1.0;93.0;Posted: May 11

Content creator, Diahborne, gifted me this game because of his passion for it. I need to play it more, but I have to say it seems really fun. I know that the game style is based off of the old Heroes Might and Magic, and I had never played those games before. I love just moving around the map with my hero and hoping that I make the right decision when I interact with things. It's sort of similar to Total War, if you've played that. Also, the art style is pretty cool and reminds me of Octopath Traveler. These style of graphics might not be everyone's preference, but I like it because it makes me feel nostalgic. For this style of game I think it fits. (I'll update this more in the future, but I wanted to give the game a good review to support it.)

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
This is a really charming little game! It wears it's inspiration on it's sleeve but it does try to do a few new things. As of right now the game has a fair amount of content and I hope that with time this will become something amazing! I'm a huge fan of HoMM so I'm definitely a bit biased because this genre doesn't get enough love.

The clear positives are the presentation and the overall pace of the game! The art is gorgeous and the animations while simple, add a lot of charm to each hero and unit. The animation speed is really good too, with map traversal being skipable and the combat animations being snappy and weighty. I'm a huge fan of the battle ending final hit zoom and slowmo. It adds a really nice hype moment.

The designs of the heroes and units are really cool. Although the game only has 4 factions as of right now, they are all unique in terms of their appearance and of course their gameplay. I'm a big fan of the undead faction with their low level rats that get frenzied when they get hit once.

There are a few things that I wish were in the game (co-op, simultaneous turns) but there's time for all of that to be added and the developers seem to be pretty receptive from what I've seen on their Discord.

I've read some reviews from more hardcore players saying that the game is too simplistic and that the magic isn't very exciting but I'm not ready to agree with that just yet. While the magic isn't as intricate as HoMM 3 for example, I definitely see potential in which spells to choose and how to chain spells effectively during your turn, since you can cast multiple per round.

Overall after playing for about 5 hours straight, I have to say I'm really optimistic about the game. There's definitely more work to be done here but I feel the devs can pull it off. The question is how quickly those updates and features will be implemented into the game. Still, as of right now I definitely recommend the game and I hope it succeeds because we absolutely need more games like this.";11.8;1.0;1.0;208.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Did you enjoy the old Heroes of Might and Magic games? If yes, then you will enjoy this game.

Units no longer stack endlessly, giving a reason and benefit to running more than one Wielder. ( Hero )

Unit slots are gained by leveling the wielders and increasing the stacks for units is increased by researching which is more of a mid game building once you've established several footholds.

Units generate a certain amount of types of essence. Essence powers spells. This adds more strategy to fielding certain units so that you can utilize specific spells. Certain factions will have certain spells more easily available to them based on their units that are available but some rare items/artifacts and structures that you capture in the world can also influence these things, as well as wielder abilities.

Battlefields now have more to them. Some elevation tiles increase and decrease the offence and defence modifiers of units.

Units have unique abilities available to them. Obviously, some are more powerful than others. I've only played the Human Campaign so far and their abilities were pretty basic. Raising attack/defence of the units around them instead of attacking. Archers have an overwatch ability where they attack any unit that moves within range of their ""zone."" This zone boosts damage significantly and can be increased with abilities, items and elevation.

So far, spells seem to range from useful to maybe too strong. I'm not sure how they scaled the essence costs to damage but they seem to need some tweaking. Chain lightning can hit for 200 several times while another spell that costs 2/3 the essence only hits for 90 and one that costs 1/3 hits for 20.

Towns are basically you walk up and claim a settlement. Once that settlement is claimed you claim all buidings that settlement contains and then you can build whatever structures you want in any empty building slots.

Building slots can be small, medium, and large. You can increase these slots through upgrading settlements and each settlement you claim has a size and maximum upgrade slot.
Defensive structures don't seem to be very strong as far as I've seen. Hopefully they can be upgraded further because the ballistas don't really do much more than tickle the enemy if they have any sizable force.

if an enemy has claimed a settlement, you can attack and then you have two options. You can raze 2 buildings a turn or you can convert the settlement to your own. I haven't razed yet so I'm not sure if your wielder has to remain in the city to raze ( which also plunders resources ) but I know if you convert it takes several turns and you do have to leave a wielder.

From what i've seen, you have access to an editor where you can make your own maps and layouts and play them out with AI or your friends. I didn't see mods yet.

Amount of wielders you can have out are tied to settlement sizes and how many you own. Each wielder appears to have their own set of unique abilities and then access to generic ones like more movement on the overworld or increasing army size.

Wielders have equipment slots for weapons and armor you find in the world. These stats all transfer to their units. Stats range from increasing essence generation, increasing offence and defence, increasing maximum troop size ( Called Command ) to reducing ranged / melee damage by a %.

The overworld has mines and structures that generate resources used in constructing and recruiting the more powerful and limited units. There is also a structure called the marketplace that allows you to convert gold into resources in case your access to some resources is limited.

There are also tons of different events and structures that grant bonuses to stats, generation, wielder boosts and experience and temporary battle boosts. Sometimes these are guarded by packs of AI which vary in strength based on what is being guarded.

As far as combat goes, it's all turn based on an Initiative stat and the order is laid out for you. There are several ways to alter this stat via wielder abilities, wielder equipment, buffs and spells.

Units have attacks of opportunity. It seems like some can do this more than once on the same unit so walking passed a heavy unit to reach a fragile ranged unit can be extremely punishing.

All in all, the game so far is rather enjoyable. I'm looking forward to some of the custom play on maps like the old Heroes of Might and Magic games. It's pretty much what I was expecting based on the trailers and game play I had seen.";7.5;1.0;3.0;117.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
IT IS NOT A HEROES GAME BUT INSPIRED IN IT.

The first impression was a SHOCK
Since i expect Heroes of might and magic Game like. Then when you understand that it is not you will like it for what it is.

But this game its different; its like a child between Heroes games and Battle brothers.
It take mechanics from both.
-Creature grow is daily not weekly (i prefer weekly but i am okey with daily)

I see the Devs are trying to improve the game, i trust they will keep on it.
Expect new patches and fixes of balance and more ads, so the game seems to have more potential in the future.

What they have to IMPROVE is how you feel playing every faction to feel it more unique in PLAYSTYLE

This review is based on about 4 hours of skirmish play, with just one faction.

As a die hard fan of HoMM3, with I guess more than 2000 hours in this game since 1999... I can have a sigh of relief, because this game, and the developers, know what they are doing, and who this game is really for.
Now the only thing to hope for is a long and prosperous support period for this game, with lots more tweaks and fine tuning, a good random map generator, a couple more factions, and this game is golden... Guaranteed a place in the hall of fame of turn-based strategy games. I am so happy and excited for the future of this game!";7.8;1.0;3.0;188.0;Posted: May 11

Awesome game! It still need some polishing and balancing, but in overall game is excellent in current state. Pixel art and graphics in general are beautiful and gives that old school charm.
Devs listen to fans feedback and are super fast in implementing good suggestions and fixing bugs, so cudos to them. Guys you are awesome! Keep up the good work.
Gameplay is similar to HoMM series, but it's not the same game. Many mechanics are different. It have somewhat ""weaker"" town development than HoMM, but it's quite good and fun. Combat is turn based as in HoMM, but to me is even more fun than in HoMM. I recommend this game to every turn based strategy fan, especially to fans of HoMM series.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
A magical distillation of HOMM2/3/4 -- streamlined to make competitive & cooperative play feasible, fun, and quick. As an enormous fan of HOMM3, and an outspoken apologist for HOMM4, it was disappointing to see the series disintegrate, so I'm so happy to see someone fill that hole in my heart so elegantly.

SoC takes all of the classic base-building, exploration, RPG-elements, and tactical combat from HOMM and shapes it into a far more balanced and board game-esque mold. Gone are the limitless troop pools and legions of heroes. Hard caps and choices based on limitations are everywhere. But this feels far more freeing rather than restrictive as the game is pleasantly designed around a more predictable growth progression that takes you to the gates of your opponent right as exploration starts to wear out its welcome.

The map design and expansion logic of the skirmishes often gave me the feeling of some kind of turn-based Starcraft with how its resources and build-sites are dispersed and managed, and I think that's a very good thing. HOMM often fell into repetitive patterns of snowballing and clashing until one person gave out. Here, intelligent choices in army composition, battle tactics, and base management are way more important.

I know some people have been turned off by SoC's magic system, but for me it's a perfect summary of what this game does right -- make every decision the player makes interesting and impactful. Never have I seen a system like this one, where your army composition has a tertiary effect of defining which spells will be available to you and how often you can cast them. And the opportunity to demolish and reshape my bases allowed me to experiment with these compositions in a synergistic way with the kinds of spell damage I wanted to inflict.

I have gripes too -- the game feels bereft of content, especially considering its price tag. Part of what made HOMM3 so incredible was the sheer depth of the world and how much you were sure to encounter. Within a single skirmish I felt like I'd encountered most of what was available -- and even though the custom map system is amazing it's still limited by the base variety the game feeds into it.

TLDR; it's HOMM perfected for multiplayer, it's beautiful to look at, and I wish there was way more of it.

It's still in EA so I hope more gets added -- not only another faction or two but just more random beasties and dungeons that could help flesh out this wonderful world.";5.4;1.0;1.0;167.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
While still in early access, this game has the potential to be a worthy spiritual successor of the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 and in general this specific type of RPG/TBS game style.
I think that the dev team behind the game is very passionate and they are doing great work!

Pros:
- It's a love letter to the HoMM 3
- The art direction is solid. Pixel art really works well with the games setting and slightly retro feel
- The gameplay is solid. You explore maps, gather resources, upgrade your town, get access to new units, improve your character, and defeat enemies on a hexagon grid map. You know, the classics. And I love it.
- The story of the campaign (while I played only a couple of hours) seems to be good enough.
- Overall the game has a good vibe

Cons
- For now, there are only 4 playable factions. For me one of the lures of these games is the wast variety of playable factions and units, so 4 seems way too little. But the game is in early access, so I have hope for more to come

- The magic system seems a bit strange. I have only played 4 hours, so maybe I have not gotten into it enough, but it feels unnecessarily convoluted - different monsters give different magic type points that increase every turn + (and maybe I'm getting this wrong) seems like every hero has access to same spells since there are no magic schools or magic learning places. That, for me, strips away a bit of the identity of each unique hero and they feel replaceable.

- There are no global wait/delay-turn actions for units in combat. Some units have that as their unique skill, but only some. I think it's a con, as it takes away certain strategy elements from the combat.

Things that are not strictly cons but I do not particularly:
- unit cap. every unit stack has a cap. for example you can have only 20 ranged units in a stack or 5 top tier units in a stack. I don't particularly care for this system, it seems restrictive for no reason

- units die fast. it seems that on average every unit has way more health points than in HoMM, Kings Bounty, and other games of the genre. So it's harder to keep your units healthy and that means that you will need to go back to your base way more often because even weak enemies can do some serious damage (as in the first turns most of the time your hero will not have access to magic, that could help)

- low-level heroes can't be used as unit shipping mules, as level 1 heroes can only have two stacks of units and you must level up to carry more stacks. tie this together with units dying fast and you have yourself a problem supporting your main heroes when they are far away from your base.

But overall - I'm very much a fan, and I will be playing this game more and following its development of it. For now, it's 8/10 for me. This is a game worth supporting.";4.6;1.0;1.0;240.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
(My hours are way more than it shows - offline mode while in alpha/beta)

ATM i would rate it 7~7.5/10 considering its EA - Calling it simpler version of HOMM3 is about 30% right and slightly insulting. Price is a bit steep and there are still some important features in works

+Graphics
+Sound FX/Music
+Fast paced combat - You can't stack bazilions troops in 1 slot, only downside is no wait command for every troop
+City Building - Though its a bit intuitive
+Wielders amount is limited by your city count - As above, no stacking into infinite and beyond

~Heavy WIP map generator
~A bit of work need to be done on tutorial
~AI needs more variety/personality

-Magic system - I like that you can't spam at start of round but rest of it doesn't feel really good
-Troops re-stock every day
-Bland level up talents
-As many other stated no keybinds setting in options";3.1;1.0;2.0;272.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
TL, DR: It's worth full price. It's an excellent successor to the HoMM franchise that innovates enough to make its own mark while retaining enough of the old designs to scratch that itch for ye olde HoMM. Buy it. BUY IT NOW.

First the campaigns:
A besieged kingdom loses its patriarch: in his place rises a hard-nosed daughter intent on proving her worth. With dark rumours of cultists, power-hungry neighbours, and restless Fey at the periphery the only question is how far she'll go to bring stability amidst a crumbling Empire.

Amidst the fires in the desert, an orphan slave is freed and returns to his home, now with a thirst for vengeance against those who have oppressed his people for so long. It doesn't matter if the world is burning as well: his people will be free from the tyranny of man.

There are four factions:
Arleon (the remnants of the broken Empire) are the archetypal human kingdom but with some fun twists thrown in. Crossbows and longmen, swords and shields - backed by oathsworn Fey that bring the fury of the forests into the mix.

Barya are merchant-states to whom contracts are law and anyone can be anything. Great for discovering new technology. Also great for enabling slavery. Win some, lose some. They rely heavily on firearms, barriers and giant brutes - including an awe-inspiring cannon that will bring the end to any battle it sees use in.

Rana are the slave-race of amphibians, dwelling in the marsh amidst giant insects, spiders, carnivorous birds and an ominous threat you'll have to discover for yourself.

The Barony of Loth is a kingdom in extreme decline. Their armies are gone, their cities are ruins and no hope left. Well, almost. You see: they're not just going to lay down and stay dead. The Barony of Loth will rise again, even if its rotting citizens must slaughter the living to see its power rise once more. Cultists and skeletons abound in this cute twist on the typical Undead faction. Needs a tad more necromancy in-game, though.

Finally, a quick summary of the tweaks the game has made that have put it, at least in my estimation, as an excellent successor to the HoMM franchise.

- Settlements have specifically sized building slots that ensure a single settlement isn't enough to build everything, but it's enough to conquer the neighbours. This makes the game vastly less centralised than HoMM is. This is a huge positive in practice because it means many more settlements changing hands throughout the game, as each map tends to have at least 6-8.
- Stack caps. Gone are the days of 300+ crossbowmen that snipe you from across the screen. Now each stack has a certain number of units it can fit (increased via research): if you want more crossbowmen, you're going to need to have multiple stacks of them. This enables a fair bit more variety in army make-up and also ensures that there is a hypothetical limit to how big a single army can be, encouraging multiples.
- Range is not infinite, units have zone of control, and there are height differences in the map that actually matter. This is pretty common among HoMM spiritual successors but is still worthy of note.
- What magic you have is based both on your hero and on your army. Each unit you buy generates essence associated with them. A swordsman might generate Order, for example. That then fuels Order spells. This is honestly a surprisingly fun premise that lets you build armies and heroes to compliment each other - like setting up a fireball mage with a bunch of destruction-essence units so they can start raining destruction with impunity. Though it also means as your units die you tend to have less and less magic to turn the tide. Gotta be careful. Nothing is truly expendable.
- Special resources, like stand-ins for mercury and crystals, are so bloody scarce that when you get the option to have a hero generate them it is unironically a compelling choice. I didn't quite like it at first but the more I thought about it the more it forced me to make difficult decisions: do I want 20% more damage, or do I want the ability to upgrade this unit or buy this research?

All that said, there are some bits that are... great, but this is also an early access game that looks like a finished game worthy of its full price. Mostly my issues boil down to the following:
- A lot of factions have units that do the same thing - this unit debuffs offense/defense/initiative in an area around them, this unit can skip their turn to provide a mild buff to all your units, etc. It has the unfortunate element of making the factions feel a bit too same-y, like they're just reskinning some units. I don't think that's the case, ofc, but I'd like to see more asymmetry where the factions are a bit more distinct in the buffs/debuffs they give and what they do.
- The Wisdom skill still exists. XP sharing I get, but ""get more XP"" just seems like a feat tax that we've moved past design-wise. Either it's an auto-buy or it's a trap; there is no in-between. It doesn't lead anywhere and, honestly, it doesn't make the game more fun. IMO: toss it and embrace exploring other possible skills. Not everything has to be HoMM-derived.
- Small creature spawns seem a tad low. It's more manageable once you get more settlements but starting off it tends to be a bit rough. Either that or I'm bad at the game. Pls fix. >:(
- The amount of Risen you get after a battle (as the Barony of Loth) is negligible, which is a bit frustrating because they take up a slot and there doesn't seem to be a way to improve the rate. That said this is early access so I'm hoping this will be addressed over time.
- The campaign songs - the ones the game is named for - are lackluster. Their pacing is weak, the rhyming rarely fits neatly. It's not even remotely a big deal, ofc, since you can just skip it. It's just a bit awkward given that it is a titular feature. Maybe they warrant remaking in the future, depending on how successful the game is. Y'know, just in case you get No Man's Sky money. ;3c

All in all it's an excellent successor to the spirit of HoMM3. It innovates enough to make it unique but maintains a lot of the elements that made the game fun to begin with. Plus I dig the pixel art. It gives the game a very unique style. I think if they continue to evolve, making the factions more distinct from one another, it will be worth way more than their current asking price.";8.7;1.0;2.0;397.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I spent many, many, MANY hours of my children and teenage years playing HoMM series (all of them). So, naturally, when SoC was announced about a a year ago, I jubilated.

I bought it on release of Early Access and was totally not disappointed! Even though it is EA, the game is very polished (I’ve come across only a single very minor bug so far) and there’s already a ton of content!
It is a true successor of the genre and it improves it in almost every aspects:
1. Number of units and number of unit stacks is limited.

The number of units and stack a Wielder (a hero) can have is based on character skills, which lessens the 1 stack of doom that plagued the genre. For example, a starting Wielder can only have a maximum of 20 archers per stack and a max of 3 units stacks. As you gain level, you can unlock new unit stacks and town upgrades allow you to increase the number of units a stack can have.

2. Town building is much deeper than in HoMM.

You are limited to a few numbers of building plot per Town level. Each plot is either Small, Medium or Large and obviously, stronger buildings require Large plots. Where this system shines is you can build multiple copies of a building if you like and you can even build smaller buildings than the plot (so Small in a Medium plot, or Medium in a Large plot), which allows a character to say, focus on one type of unit and maximizes its per turn production, or even skip certain units you don’t want. And to top it all, you can sell unwanted buildings, so you can choose to build something only to fill the requirement of another stronger building and then replace the former with something that would actually help you recruit or upgrade the new stronger unit (like income-based building for example).

3. Combat feels about the same but is a bit improved.

You can dive in with the same nostalgia; most of the mechanics are the same. Your Wielder’s stats increase your units’, units have a movement stat, initiative, attack, defense, and some special abilities (passive or active). What’s novel here is that you don’t learn new spells, instead, you have access to all spells but Mana accumulates based on units. Every time a unit activates, it generates a specific amount of a certain type of Mana, which in turn unlocks spells. So don’t expect to run the 1 black dragon with Armageddon type of strategy, you’d at least need specific units that generate the Mana you need to cast the spell and it would likely take a few turns to do so. There’s also the inclusion of Height which gives Defense, Attack and Range bonus, which dynamize the battle a bit.

4. Exploration is same good feel.

Pixel graphics are really nice, with some really good looking modern effects added in which doesn’t clash with the art style at all. The gameplay is what you expect: run around with your heroes based on a Move stat, activate buildings, claim mines, fight mobs, discover artifacts and resources. Your number of Wielder is limited, so you can’t run around with a dozen of heroes with a single unit just to claim resources or beeline between towns. Gladly though, there’s a building you can build that allows you to recruit units from other towns.

5. Campaigns have good narrative.

While not novel-worthy, the narration is good. The first campaign is a tutorial that walks you through the basics without handholding, which is a blessing. It only limits your choices and introduce you to new elements at a steady pace. It also introduce you to the lore and the 4 factions.

Tl;dr: It’s a really good strategy game, proud successor to the HoMM series (but better).";7.2;1.0;2.0;190.0;Posted: May 12

Fan of HoMM 1-5 and immediately fell in love with Songs of Conquest. Intelligently builds upon the classics without being a simple remake, but rather SoC brings a lot of fresh ideas to the table. Can't believe it's still early access. Recommend playing the 128*128 maps cause the 64*64 feel crowded, like tiny HoMM maps. I also limited FPS to 40 via Nvidia Experience like I usually do to go easy on my CPU. If you experience any performance issues, then try that. Can't wait to continue my skirmish map. Barya ftw! This game will even get better during further development. Thank you, dear devs! The relatively steep price tag is perfectly fine given the quality of the game.

There is a unique magic system, lots of RNG, and lots of replay value. The graphics, music, and atmosphere are all top tier. Highly recommend.";355.4;1.0;4.0;61.0;Posted: May 10

So far I love it.

Most of the mechanics I have loved on HoMM3 are here and enjoy the game's new features.

There are only 2 campaigns but it´s the first day of early access so it´s understandable.

I looking forward to more content (maps, campaigns, nations, artefacts etc.)

From my point of view is this project most promising successor of HoMM3 so far (It´s 23 years now from release).

Let´s support this game and help to make the new generation of HoMM3 Complete and even much more than that --> SoC Complete";11.6;1.0;1.0;48.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Game is really neat so far, but it is borderline unplayable. AI is seriously rigged and really really ruins the experience. Get ready to constantly be in shock at the sheer difficulty creep in the campaign and be utterly confused as the ""easy"" AI barrages you army after army as you struggle to fund any endeavour. Maybe you'll have a better experience with multiple AI? Prepare to be targeted and have random ""You lose"" screens come up for no apparent reason ending your game without warning or response.

Also the rats are seriously overpowered, AI pumps out full stacks of them no issue and they hit way harder than they should.

When they AI gets told to chill the F out I'll update the review to the frustrating but otherwise really cool game.";7.7;0.0;7.0;178.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I actually really like the game. I wish I could give a mixed review. Songs of Conquest has amazing sprite graphics, great audio direction and music. The units are interesting if a bit generic in combat. There is a good flow to the upgrade system, magic has depth and is satisfying to use in battle. Unfortunately I am mainly interested in games like this for multiplayer, and I don't think the offering is quite there yet. This style of game basically amounts to being a turn based MOBA where you are gaining power on your heroes and then engaging in battle elsewhere on the map. There is a lot of downtime and PVE content even in multiplayer. I like slow paced games, but with the way games are played today I don't think people will want to wait 5~ minutes on average for their opponent to clear monsters and finish their moves. Simultaneous turns seem like a must for this style of game. Since there is no turn timer currently implemented, if your opponent wants to just walk away from their computer you suffer for it. Will return to the game after some updates!";3.6;0.0;11.0;308.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Full disclosure - I received the key for free. I am giving this game a positive review with a clear conscience. Long story short its a great revitalisation of a genre destroyed by ubisoft.

The good:
+ game feels well polished at this stage
+ fantastic high production value pixel art
+ very nice looking menu
+ good music/sounds
+ campaign map looks great
+ manual combat - very nice, fast, to the point, looks like you stripped all unnecessary complications and delays
+ campaign missions feel good, felt more engaged than AoW or Homm3 due to more exposition to plot through small short chats
+ double click to instant move on campaign map
+ limits to size of armies (no more million skeletons armies)
+ town upgrades are cool, need getting used to but cool
+ alt tabbing works well, smooth
+ manual battle map much better, elevation etc
+ combat magic looks good, not op from start
+ useful spells!
+ menu to control unit size etc so great, much better than other games
+ i can pick up resource on a cliff (right on the edge, don't have to be on it!)
+ devs actually engaged community for pre-release testing unlike devs on KoH2...

The neutral:

¬ main menu theme doesn't feel as impactfull as AoW or Homm3
- I like the combat magic but its not intuitive on how it works, i notice it shows up the longer combat lasts but I cant immediately see what action influence it

The bad:

- in combat no clear skip turn button, i can end turn but that doesnt regain any initiative or reschuffle attack queue
- less weapons more meaningful choices please? I saw that some weapons have bonuses like +150 gold, maybe add skills etc";7.6;1.0;5.0;1942.0;Posted: May 10

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
*received the game free as gift*

TL:DR
- Game is fun and has potential, however IMO there are some QoL issues surrounding the economy & battle strategy that need to be ironed out before the game can really take off.

Overall the game is fun to play and relies on a deep sense of strategy and forward planning on the part of the player, however, I think it needs to critical QoL tweaks before I can fully recommend it to someone else:

1. The difficulty rating system for battles is CRITICALLY OFF. I've fought a fair share of battles from every difficulty level just to get a sense of what i'm dealing with and for starters,(medium) difficulty should be labeled (Hard). Honestly, every battle rating should be increased by one. That is, Medium ---> Hard, Hard --> Worthy, etc. I've seen too many battles that were labeled medium and were completely unbalanced ensuring defeat.

2. More money, or more resources. The settlement economy is awful, borderline 2007 recession when it comes to money it seems. Even when adventuring out to find additional sources of money & resources it never seems to be enough. On the other hand, it seems that the AI always has just enough money to consistantly harass you with ""Medium"" level stacks. Even with (3) settlements making 5000 per turn I still couldn't recruit troops fast enough, and eventually get harassed to death.

3. Please god allow us to click on our buildings and view resources when outside of our turn, or for that matter simultaneous turn taking is better.

4. Just like in Warhammer, if too wielders are within a certain proximity to each other allow their troop stacks to combine during battle. Preventing this causes my ""troop transport' wielder to get targeted every time, they die, and then I'm left without troop replenishment to fight (2) enemy wielders back to back.

5. Increase money resource values from farms/huts/etc from various factions. If I choose to forgo another building to increase my income, make it worthwhile at least.

That's all I got for now. Don't get me wrong, its a good game and has lots of potential, but until some QoL issues are resolved, I'd have a hard time selling the game to someone else given my current issues. Or, I would only tell my friends who enjoy strategy-heavy turn-taking strategies that are less forgiving for going outside of the faction-meta.

Additionally, although I haven't quite figured out what they are yet, I can already tell that some factions have broken metas.";10.1;0.0;4.0;124.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
So, we all know what kind of games inspired this one. So my first comment is going to be that while it is very similar in a lot of ways, it is also quite different. Yes, you explore, you flag buildings, you raise armies etc, but you also need to pick just what buildings you want in semi-permanent choices, you can raze places instead of conquering them like in Warlords, and you gain mana by actions in combat rather than through some big mana pool so you can't just throw giant spells at enemies out the gate. In many ways this has, if not bettered the original formula then at least switched it up to a worthwhile degree.

There are issues, of course. The game chugs a bit on larger maps after a long enough time building your towns up, there's a few missing tooltips and the chances of you winning battles is not correct yet whatsoever. But these are all issues I expect the devs to resolve before this leaves early access.";7.3;1.0;1.0;969.0;Posted: May 13

Runs flawlessly on MacBook Air M1

Awesome game, clearly inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic, but that’s ok, because those games are 30 years old now. Visuals are retro chic, as is the style at the moment but also so much easier for a small developer to pull off; pretty for the style. Gameplay feels very similar to the aforementioned HOMM series but with some new tweaks and expanded ideas. I’ve only dig into 1 of the 2 available campaigns at this point but so far I’m having a great time and have had no technical issues.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
If I could put this at a middle thumb I would. There are great ideas and artists at work here and I would recommend this game to any hardcore strategy game enjoyers. I really would have liked to put it at a 10/10, but the game is definitely not finished and I would not pay 30$+ for what there's in it if I never played a HOMM before. Anyway, here are my pros and cons, some of them I already know would have been an issue before launch.

Pros

- Gorgeous and charming game, the team at Lavapotion really put their art and soul into this, it's very easy to tell.
- Great music.
- Visual effects and the clarity of the game like the UI is clean.
- Very unique and different ideas of your usual HOMM-like game; the town building and how magic works in the game using different troops synergies called ''essence'' to cast spells.
- Has a map editor straight out at release.
- No game breaking bugs at launch that I'v experienced.
- Battles are fun, fast and simple.

Cons

- Biggest disapointment/issue to me about this game to me was that items, factions research & wielder powers felt pretty bland and uninspiring. Weapons and items are just stat sticks that gives bonus attack/defense/gold whatever the rarity, nothing fancy here. Same for factions research, bonus to attack, more ressources, etc. more of the same, really wish there would have been exciting and game changing stuff, could have been more creative.

- Another big one to me was the design decision of limiting maximum troops a stack can have, I really don't get this one, very limiting and I don't see why this decision would make the game fun, just remove it. I got so many troops from camps and my main town during my Arleon campaign that were just wasted and sitting in town or had to pick the gold instead. Research to upgrade the maximum stack at the academy is not enough to fix this(+5 per node I think). Like I said, just remove it.

- Game is pretty short, it does feel a bit unfinished and i'm glad they put it as an early access, there's only 2 campaigns with 4 missions each. I hope they will add more content and DLCs, the game definitely deserves it in its current state.

- Stutters when moving the camera around the map, might be not well optimized for the moment, I tried every graphic settings and still got stutters and fps drop even though my pc can run anything well.

- Although the combat and magic feels good visually, it lacks depth compared to other AoW/HoMM games. Whatever the faction you play, whoever strikes first, it's always more of the same, barely any strategy and magic feels pretty rudimentary with no creativity to branch off and be a powerful mage or a tactician.

Overall, my biggest let down was definitely the lack of distinction between factions/loot/Wielders beside just the look of them. On the outside, you look at the game and you see how good and charming the game is but once you start digging underneath it, you realise there's not much to chew on.";2.9;0.0;3.0;87.0;Posted: May 11

In it's current state, I would not recommend the game.

The biggest complaint I have is the A.I. cheating bs. Was playing on the campaign (human) and made it to the third map. Right after barely killing the undead hero two turns later a Fae one comes in and takes my town. Nothing I could do to stop this. I thought okay, maybe it's something I'm not getting so decided to load up a skirmish 1v1 vs undead.

Doing as best as u possibly can I wiped out the main enemy army (was on par with mine), kill his 2nd commander w/ army, then he has a third one (just as strong as the main) and then the next turn I bring my second army over and it loses to his third then he resurrects his main hero with another full army and attacks my main. The current bonuses the A.I. gets just makes the game stupid.";4.4;0.0;9.0;251.0;Posted: May 11

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Honestly, I am a bit disappointed. I have waited years for this to come out, following development very closely. I am a huge fan of HoMM, AOW 3, etc.. These games are usually much more complex in combat and city development. However, SoC just doesn't add enough layers of unique fighting style to the combat. The spells system is very boring and takes too much time/development to even be useful. The biggest defining feature to the unique ""races"" was their color/art differences, otherwise the combat plays out the same - whoever bashes the other enemy faster wins with very little play into strategy tactics. City development was confusing and left a lot to be desired. Multiplayer was a huge let down with the lack of Simultaneous turns in the 21st century - its just not enjoyable without that feature.

Perhaps the game improves with more development. I hope it does - I might give it another go. But for now I will let the game sit for another year.";1.8;0.0;20.0;232.0;Posted: May 11

I consider this game to be hitting close to ""home"" as it helps me remenice the golden era of my childhood and it being HoMM :) - I enjoy the art style and the direction the developers took and the game is quickly becoming a ""cozy"" getaway from reality. I do understand that this is meant to be a review but rather then telling you about the pros and cons I actually would rather encourage you to purchase the game and try it for yourself even if it means ""Testing it for 2hours (steam refund policy) just to have an actual feel for the game and the magic the devs have created. I do not want to say anything misleading or give my personal opinions as everybody experiences things differently.

PS. The devs are very transparent, understanding and what was most surprising is how communicative they have been throughout the whole testing process. They spent a lot of their time listening and investigating as well as brainstorming fixes, additions and improvements to the game with our little community.

I do however, hope you enjoy the game and are happy to take it further by ""keeping it and letting it grow on you"" :)

If you grew up playing Heroes Might & Magic Like me then this game is especially for you!

At first glance when you look at it, its pixel art. You may say who does that anymore? But believe me creators did an amazing job, creating the world that is alive that breaths. Your desire arises to explore more and more to discover.

I like building system. It can give you anything but you have to ""sacrifice"" some of other building for the sake of another one.You have to think strategically for what you need now for the most.I love buildings for enchanted purposes for inventory or for units or four slots it makes big differences in battles its very smart making I love it

Skills are fun. You can either wait for more sensitivity or use what you got for the moment (in battle) I think some of big digit number sense skills need more damage (just my opinion its just balances talking) I'm hoping more and more skill will be added in the future

Battles are fun too. Of course you can use some of strategies some for tank some to carry for ranger or for ""buffer"" I think starting positions need to be revisited at first it's fun you think strategically where to put your unit when against some idle units. But if you are against, for example friend and you know he got dragons and need to protect your ranger starting positions doesn't help that much for this. other then that its super fun.

I hope more units, races and skills will be added in the future

Thanks you LAVA POTION we always play headset with my friends by side.
Today we had a super blast we enjoyed playing this so much. It's so good if you got defeated doesn't automatically mean you lost, you can still purchase units conquer friends other settlements.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Songs of Conquest has in many brought inspiration from the Heroes of Might and Magic series and you called also that is a HOMMage to them in some ways. (see what I did there?) Then again it isn't a re-skin of said games by any means, but a polished graphically beautiful and thought-out awesome game, that should stand frontier to the genre/type of game that we loved.

Although you can see similarities between this game and the HOMM series taht it has taken inspiration from, it does enough to be newand has it's own thing going for it. It is by far and large a totally different experience and I don't mean it in a bad way.

I'm saying this because I was expecting a HOMM clone yet I got a totally new game which might put some people off at first, but if you take the time to learn about all the new features like the Essence system, or how the skills/units work you will find yourself putting hours and hours of game-time into a world that is most pleasing to look at as well as having an all around fun combat.

Not to mention that the devs are awesome people and they're down to earth, working close with the community as they try to make their passion come to life. They're humble and most definitely focused on getting this game come true and the best that it can be.

So all in all Songs of Conquest is an awesome game that although may seem to be another knock at the HOMM series' games, it does enogh and more to be it's own thing in a good way!
The combat is fun and deep with graphics that suit the world as well as making the combat fluid and gnarly, with great music and sound design.

I hope you find yourself playing SOC after reading this review, and believe this game is 2000x times more fun than my rambling on here. So get out there and kill some of those Ranas (Oh GOD not the toads oh please...)";19.9;1.0;0.0;76.0;Posted: May 12

Long time fan of the Heroes of Might & Magic 3 series, currently playing Homm3 Complete with Horn of the Abyss.
This game is a solid foundation on which to keep building and improving. They got it down right. The new combat systems, the magic, the music, the graphics, oh the graphics, I love it. It's still lacking a Random map generator and i hope they will add one some day. I'd say they must because a lot of people who still play Homm3 only plays it because the feeling of starting on an unkown map. Anyway, i say support it if you can and enjoy the Homm franchise, these people have the heart in the right place. They are picking up the slack on what the later installments of Homm Failed to do. Homm3 will probably allways own the crown but give this one some time and it might just be the next best thing, it's allready so close.";15.2;1.0;0.0;286.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
10,000,000 Zombies vs. 50,000 WW2 Soldiers
I wanted to see how many units the engine could handle, so I threw a truly outrageous amount of zombies into it. The map loaded up. All of the units appeared. My FPS was hovering around 4. Totally unplayable. To its credit, it warned me it would be unplayable with that many units and even better is it DID actually load and run. So i quit and lowered the number of zombies to a more reasonable amount.

5,000,000 Zombies vs. 50,000 WW2 Soldiers:
Wow. Not only did this run, but it ran fairly well. Absolutely playable, so here's how it went:
I picked the map with the river with multiple bridges. Massive (that's 5 MILLION) zombie horde on one side, 50,000 WW2 soldiers on the other, placed 5,000 at a time at each bridge.
The game loaded relatively quick and I pressed the button to start the battle. The zombies started splitting off and heading towards the nearest foes, as did the soldiers. The problem here is that some of the zombies were far enough away that the soldiers crossed one of the bridges to attack, losing their strategic advantage.

The AI is fairly simple. Units will head for the shortest route to their enemies, and then stand in a massive blob waiting to attack. Nothing too exciting, but it works well enough for hordes of zombies.

I let the game run on its own for a while, and when I came back I found that the zombies had (unsurprisingly) massacred the soldiers that had crossed the bridge and were now slowly streaming their way up to the other bridges, which were still holding just fine. It seemed that a relatively small force could hold off the zombies at a bridge, especially since they don't swim. This is when I decided to take action and use what I think is one of this game's strongest features. RTS Mode.

I peeled off a small company of soldiers from a bridge that was being held just fine and started marching them down towards the zombies that had made it through. I split the force into 2 groups and slowly worked them up towards the bridge, one group moving while the other covered it. In a few minutes I had retaken the bridge. I made sure to issue an order for them to hold the position, and I left them to defend. Turning my attention to the rest of the battlefield, I found that some other soldiers were pushing too aggressively. They had pushed the zombies across the bridge and followed, but if they attracted too many zombies they would get overrun and another bridge would be open for the zombies to attack. I quickly grabbed some units from another nearby bridge and had them fire on the zombies while I pulled the squad back across the bridge to hold that position. Perfect. All bridges covered, no zombies advancing. At this point, I had lost nearly half of my units, while the zombies still numbered in the millions.

After some waiting, I noticed that some areas were thinning out the zombies, so I decided to go on the offensive. I grouped up some units from these bridges while leaving some to defend just in case, and began advancing on the flanks of the zombies, which were now split into two giant groups on either side of the map. I slowly advanced the soldiers, and as they did more and more zombies would peel off from the groups at the bridges and come to attack my offensive line. Not enough though. I was able to slowly work through this group of over a million zombies and clear out this one side of the map.

At this point, the mountains of zombie corpses were so high by the bridges still defending that I was worried the zombies would be able to cross the river, which was now red. The entire landscape had been coated in blood. Low spots had practically formed new rivers that fed into each other. The landscape was being transformed with corpses and blood.

Once I cleared out the top half of the map, I issued an order for all the units up there to start marching on the lower half. It was only a matter of time before the zombies were wiped out, and they were. The last bridge to be cleared of zombies was the one that had originally been overtaken. It had held out this entire time with the handful of units I had left there. Finally, the last few zombies were picked off and I achieved victory.

Now, I could have just left the game alone once I retook the bridge that had been overrun, and I probably would have won just the same. However, being able to take control of these massive numbers of units and take the fight to the overwhelming opposition and WIN? That's awesome. I played the original game a bit, but found it a bit dull after doing a few battles. Placing down a couple blobs of units and watching them run into each other for a while can only be fun for so long.

In this game I was worried that it would suffer from the same issue, just on a MUCH larger scale. RTS mode removes that worry. The game is still pretty slim on content, but what has been achieved with this new engine... It's hard to really even put into words how it feels to see that many units on screen and have the game perform anywhere near acceptably. More than that, to actually be able to issue commands to the units and have them (mostly) follow those orders? Wow.

The engine is an incredible achievement, and the actual gameplay makes me excited for where they could take this. RTS mode is the thing that brings what could be another dull unit blob-fest up to another level, and I hope that the developers continue to expand on it. Could we see this turn into a full-fledged RTS? I hope so. If not, there's still some great content here for battle simulations on a truly epic scale.";4.1;1.0;141.0;418.0;Posted: 13 May

Incredibly impressed and a lot of fun... especially for early access

Pros:
- Easily get 1,000,000+ units with no issue
- RTS game mode allows you to give orders to the units and is very responsive
- AI somehow seems to be quite intelligent, which is impressive given the scale

Cons:
- Needs more maps & units.. but this will come in time with updates and the mod/workshop
- Water mechanics are still quite buggy

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The store page showed some impressive AI of a spartan fighting 3 footman. However, that cant happen during battles because there is no space for the AI to fight like that. They charge into each other like 2 waves colliding and then cant move backward, left or right, just foward stabbing each other in place until one falls and another one steps up. They are all too sandwiched together to actually fight.

All the fighting takes place in a thin line across the map 1 row deep. There needs to be a no mans land between the 2 armies so that the AI can maneuver/dance in combat. Units should go into the middle of the no mans land to fight with each other. This shoulder to shoulder, single file, thin line of combat across the map is very boring. There is a decent first person mode that could be serious fun if that no mans land gap was created, making an actual arena between the 2 armies for you and the AI to fight in.

The true problem with this video game: The scale works against it. What I mean is, because of how massive the battles can be, the animations are VERY basic, not the most fun thing to watch, especially if youve ever zoomed in on the combat of a total war game.... And if watching the battle isnt fun that just leaves RTS mode or control a unit directly mode. Both of these features are hampered by the scale as well. The battles are so large that controlling a few units at a time doesnt matter, nor can you tell them anything but ""go here"" they dont have formations or attack unit or attack groups, nothing.... Its fails as an RTS in its currrent state. ( I know its in early access)

The final mode is control a unit. Controlling a unit is kinda dull in 1 rank deep single line combat. Its fun for 5 minutes. The battles need to be more open. (As I said above)........The thing about controlling a single unit is, rather its a 2 million man battle or a 6 million man battle, you cant tell the difference when you are that zoomed in. You can only see the thousands of men around you. I would rather have 2 million man battles with more combat mechanics to bring it closer to bannerlord meets total war than to have 6 million man battles with basic animations that are boring to watch and play. How many times do you plan on watching tanks kill chickens ya know. None of it is lasting content.

I want to see this game flesh out the melee combat, it could be total war with 2 million man battles in first person, instead of this lower quality 6 million man tech demo. (I did a 6 million man battle and it ran fine so theres room to drop scale and add gameplay mechanics.)

This tech demo is good, but I wouldnt call this much of a game. Its also 15 bucks so I wish there was a maybe button. Im keeping it, but after using epic fantasy battle simulator, trying to create battles in this game is awful by comparison. They should copy them. Its enjoyable making battles in that game, its a chore in this one.";1.5;0.0;27.0;92.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I'm writing this the day the game came out. I'm mostly impressed with the game with it being much more polished, flexible and capable of what it can handle than the first one which was great but very unpolished and sometimes janky. but this one is much better, being able to have many more armys, mechanics and millions of troops on the battle field, while the first crashed after about 100,000 units total. Clearly it still needs a lot of work such as adding more units and maps, but I also think it was a little early to release even for early access.
Pros:
-Larger unit numbers
-Smarter AI
-Good Graphics
Cons:
-Not enough units and maps
-Released too early
-Minor glitches and graphical issues
-Not much content yet

I think I was a little hasty to buy this game. If you are sceptical/ unsure if you want this game then I suggest waiting a bit to see if the updates make the game a game you want to play.

Ideas for Devs:
-Lots of unit variants similar to the Total War francis
-Ancient Asia with Samurai, Ninjas, etc
-Much more fleshed out Unit creator
-Dynamic maps like the avalanches from UEBS 1
-DLC maps or units and/or campaigns
-Greek Hoplites and Athenians, Spartans get too much love
-More fantasy units
-Try to give every faction some love, UEBS 1 had a lot of factions with only 1 or 2 units in them";3.7;1.0;6.0;22.0;Posted: May 13

On the plus time its very stable and I wouldn't have thought 1 million romans would lose to 10 fully auto Shermans lol

It's a great foundation to build on (performance is impressive) but I presume it's taken this long to get stable as there's just not enough content and one thing that really annoys me is the Dev did the same with the first one which is they seem to think that key bindings in game (you can change some key bindings on the launcher) and especially invert camera are a feature NOT to have at go live. I mean really!!

Really keen to see this grow as if it becomes the Garry's Mod of battle simulators and the community get behind it then it will blossom into something truly awesome. (In that sense modding needs to be a well oiled experience)

Absolutely insane potential, I can run 3 million units on high settings at 40fps. Insane. Graphics, animations, voice lines are all much better then before. I can even run 6 million at 5 fps on high settings which is insane. This tech just blows my mind. This is essentially just a tech demo at the moment but once more units and maps are either added or modded then the sky is the limit. I highly suggest checking this out even on lower end PCs as it should still run great (maybe not 3 million units great but still). Can't wait for future updates.

Same as the first game, only with more people on screen. While that function of the game is impressive, we've somehow lost some functionality from the first game. Maximum team count has been HALVED from 8 to 4, we've lost some units and gained others, and the ability to split teams into multiple groups is not available. The RTS mode is clunky and fiddly, and drops performance, at least in my case.

On Day1 of Early Release, the game is fun and I can see how it's bones are better than the first game but it's pretty much the same game currently. I would suggest they add a few more base unit models before releasing the full game and not rely on mods too much. The game speed should be more easily adjustable as well. My final suggestion is if the ""placement boxes"" for units could somehow fill the environment space, then it would be cool to make the German Soldiers, for example, hold out a temple building (rather than trying to awkwardly place that box there and adjust everything.

Ever have those arguments with your friends about who would win: 5 trillion 5-year-olds and one 6-year-old or 5 trillion 5-year-olds and two 4-year-olds, the Incredible Hulk or his weight in Fire Ants, 7 septillion lions or the sun, a grahams number of gorillas or a googl of Master Chiefs, one stick or 3 billion NAVY SEALs?

Well, you can't quite do it to scale like that in this game, but it's a damn good start.
I easily ran a game of 600k Spartans vs 4 million Zombies. The framerate was smooth, the animations were incredibly detailed, and it was very interesting watching the path finding and tactics the AI would use.
I will say this; the game as it is now is very unfinished. Not in a bad way. It runs just fine. There's just a lot to be desired like more units, cheats, campaign, more more more.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Since I know for me and maybe some other people who have lower end PCs, the ability to really make some of these battles epic was a concern. So i ran my computer through what it could really do. I didn't get into the exact number of units that I tried out but as the numbers got higher I made it a more general unit amount. Anyway, to start, here is what I am running off of....

MSI GF65
i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz
32gb DDR4 2666
1660ti w/ 6gb
1tb kingston boot drive
1tb samsung evo (""steam drive"")
(quick edits - by saying ""seamless below I mean no frame drops and also my graphics settings were set at mid-range with everything set to ""High"")

I figured that units that used projectiles would probably be the ones that use the most and this turned out to be correct. What I topped out at in this aspect was 1.5million vs 1.5million archers. This game a seamless performance. I wasn't able to get the game itself to crash when I did higher amounts but to be honest I wasn't patient enough to let it run itself down to a more seamless unit total.

As far as non-projectile units I was able to keep a smooth 2.5million vs 2.5million foot soldiers. Again, I tried the higher numbers without a crash and I did not wait for it to wear down to a more stable amount.

Let me preface this by saying I never played UEBS 1 so if I mention something that was also in that game...oh well!

There are a few pretty cool things about this game other than its performance. When large amounts of units are killed their blood will run in the natural channels of the landscape. You don't actually see it flow so much as it is like watching a towel soak up something wet if that makes sense. There a several units to choose from but even at that, you can use existing models and customize their stats and names and make them whatever you want. Its pretty cool.

The ability to watch it play out, play a single soldier, or control several troops at once is pretty cool as well.

The loading screens and the menus are a bit rudimentary but I see two reasons why this shouldn't matter. First of all, it is early access and we can't expect a spit polish on this and second...lets be honest....who buys this game for the menus Its not Ultimate Epic Menu Simulator now is it?

TL:DR The dev hardware/performance stats in the discussions seem to be pretty close if not slightly underrated (but in my opinion that is better than overrated!) and it is a great game to play!";4.6;1.0;1.0;33.0;Posted: May 14

4: roman soldiers legs look like the legs of a person who just regained their ability to walk and are super thin
5: random floating objects on the mountain map mid air
6: cant enter some spaces & legs phase through some floors

but this game is actually really good & the most fun ive had in ages and its super fun just looking at well over 1,000,000 people go at it

also it needs more troops eventually

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I saw this game on YouTube and couldn't stop watching the gameplay. Figured, why not give it a shot? WHOA!!! This is awesome... Graphics are beautiful, animations are great, addiction is an issue, but that's a really great issue when it comes to this game. Also, the gameplay glitches make it funny AF sometimes, which I'm sure will get fixed when it's fully completed, but for the time being, seeing a tank retreat off into the hills while running away from Chuck Norris makes actual sense IRL. All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10 in it's current state, and that's not me trying to find a reason to kick it down. Legitimately, this game could be a 10/10 when campaign unlocks, and the modding community has their way, and I'll be here for each update as the game grows and grows.";4.7;1.0;1.0;34.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Pretty much does everything better than the first one. The scale has been dialed up to 11, so you can have way more characters on screen while being optimized way better than the first. I could easily handle over a million on screen with graphics maxed out and no visible frame drops, and I haven't tried to see how far I can push it.
Everything just feels better. Every unit isn't a copy-paste, so there's a small degree of variety for some, so they don't all look identical.
The only ""complaint"" at this point is the lack of content compared to the first, but it's early access. Even if a full version of the game had less content than the first, it just does everything so much better that it makes up for it.";1.6;1.0;1.0;815.0;Posted: May 13

Tried 1M Spartans vs 1M Archers - Game was like ""I got this no problem""

Ait, i'mma see how far i can push you.

So i tried 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Million units.... ON EACH SIDE! and even though i had low FPS the fact that the game had 10M units on ultra graphics all showing on my ultrawide monitor just blew my mind.

This game just fulfilled some of my dream RTS scenarios. Who doesn't wanna see 1M+ archers shoot at the same time :D";2.5;1.0;1.0;208.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
As of right now, The game is worse than the original less content and functionality. Claiming to have accomplished more than the predecessor is baloney, with with a RTX 2060 I can barely get a decent framerate with 10k units compared to the original that started to lag at 100k. The only, ""Improvement"" would be the god powers and maps, but even thats a stretch, the god powers aren't even that great. The ability to take control of single units is poor, the rts mode is poorly designed, and the custom units are less customizable. If you want to support the developers, buy the original and wait for this game to be updated, it seems like the road ahead for the game is great, but as of right now its worth about 50 cents on a good day. This game was not ready for an early access release.";4.2;0.0;11.0;194.0;Posted: May 13

I was going to have an early night. I was. And yet here I am, at four am, watching a tidal wave of Chuck Norrises murder four hundred thousand ducks with their brawny fists. I sip my whisky and wonder briefly about my future. How will I perform at my new job? Is moving in with my partner the right decision? Have I saved enough money? I quickly put these thoughts to one side and take another sip of the whisky. I have far more pressing concerns this morning.
Who would prevail in a fight between five Sherman tanks, and a million shrimps?

Mounds of zombie corpses at the ends of bridges where they run into hails of arrows from archers.

Insane amount of units can be deployed like 1 000 000 zombies

This must be the most crazy strategy game ever. Prepair massive fights between zombies and war ducks, let German soldiers team up with Sherman tanks,...

Of course this game is known for the fights with thousands of fighters. Even 1 million units will work. Do you want to know how 300 Spartans will take care of 1 000 000 Persians? This might be the perfect game for you.

Of course this is very early access, so the game may be a bit laggy time by time. There is also an option to take over a unit on the battlefield or there is cinematic option.... I have read with some people this work, but with me it doesn't...

For now there is only a sandbox mode. Campaign missions will be added later. The units could be customized. So you could change their strength and such.

But is it really needed to buy this game if you own the first game? Yes, the performance is better then the first one. So that's all up to yourself. Of course, if you don't own the first one, this will be the better buy.

In this video you could see what kind of crazy stuff is possible in this game:";3.1;1.0;2.0;4301.0;Posted: May 13

Totally love this game. Waited so long for this, ntb with 1070, tried 4 milion units... totally satisfied, with same ntb struggled with just 100 000 units in first UEBS.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The state of the game at release is absolutely abysmal. It's essentially the same game as the first UEBS with:
-Slightly better graphics (they're still not good ones unless you want your PC to explode).
-A fluid system that barely works and looks terrible.
-A few more animations, these animations are actually quite nice to look at, but due to the scale of the game, you largely never see them.
-Better performance with large armies. This is nice from an advertising point of view, but in reality it just makes battles long and boring.
-MUCH less unit variety, I assume they were relying on modders to do this for them later on.
-A slightly higher price tag.
-Fewer maps, again, likely relying on modders here.
-An extremely janky RTS system which has a few features which are never described to you in any shape or form.

Overall, extremely disappointed with this. I loved the first game and even though it was objectively worse than this one, I anticipated so much more from the hype produced on their YouTube channel. If things improve with the full release, I may give this another look. I encourage you to do the same, despite the ongoing sale.";0.4;0.0;10.0;61.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Not sure why this game is getting good reviews. There seems to be no attempt at actually simulating actual combat power, which kind of makes the whole thing pointless. The first thing I did in game was pit 50 WWII assault troops vs 100,000 spartan warriors, at a distance of about a quarter mile. The 50 WWII troops got NO kills and were unceremoniously wiped out without landing a shot. Obviously not remotely realistic.

Next I pitted 50 Sherman tanks against the same 100,000 Spartans, and the tanks got wiped out quickly. Granted this time I actually managed to kill some spartans, but lets be real, spartans are going to absolutely nothing to a Sherman.

This game seems to be a spectacle simulator, not a battle simulator.";0.1;0.0;21.0;316.0;Posted: May 13

3.camera is to slow when moving since the maps are so big
4.we cant map out where units go like the original (kinda miss it)
5. really nothing else i have noticed there are a lot more things like mods and more units and maps but since this is a alpha release i do understand but overall just a really good game i loved the original this is just a huge improvement over it and for such a small studio they have done an amazing job";6.4;1.0;2.0;45.0;Posted: May 13

In its current state, yes, it can handle millions of units and thats epic... But, same issue as the last game, lack of units. like... BIG TIME lack of units. I will indeed give it a thumbs up if it gets to the point of 100+ units, but if u gonna make a game completely about units and battles, make a lot of them so a lot of battles can happen. Will update this if the issue is resolved, but, aside from that, amazing game and worth the wait. lack of content is just terrible tho.

But it will surely run very good on lower spec PC`s aswell!

However atm there is a lack of content for:

More Units
More Maps
More and better optimized god Powers
and of course Workshop content (surely there will be a lot of stuff in a couple of weeks haha)

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I've not played the first one, but this doesn't strike me as being quite ready for early access. The performance is fine (though I've only been messing in the sandbox mode with no more than 20000 units or so in total) - i9 9900k / 32 GB RAM / 11 GB GTX 1080Ti / NVMe SSD / 3840x1600.

The unit abilities seem unbalanced out of the box. Medieval archers, for example, appear to be shooting sticks of celery at a red coat army I made because the red coats are practically invulnerable to the supposed arrows. There's also not nearly enough unit types, even for early access.

Unit placement is a PITA. Why can't we just resize the box instead of typing in a number? That strikes me as something you'd be doing in a game's initial conceptual stage - not in the alpha. Put the density number field in the unit box itself so we can see the density of each box at a glance of the map, and then allow us to rotate and resize each box with the mouse. This should already have been in place and was the straw in the coffin for me on why this is not suitable for even early access.

I also can't find a way to pan around with the camera at a faster speed. The camera is VERY slow.";1.4;0.0;8.0;81.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Like the Mona Lisa, Displayed in an Empty Field.

Ultimate Epic Simulator 2 is a revolutionary game, and I am pleased to say that it performed as advertised in my session. I was able to get 3,000,000 independent units to fight in a single battle rather smoothly with my GTX 1660S, while it struggled to even simulate 30,000 in the previous installment. That's 100x the improvement!

However, it is very lacking in unit variation compared to the first game. One thing I liked about the previous game is having a hierarchy of unit types of a specific era. Take for example the Footman, which has a superior variant - the Heavy Knight, with the Golden Knight being the most powerful swordsman. This roster of units opens wondrous scenarios such as ""holding until stronger reinforcements arrive"" or ""mix skilled armies"", like a well stirred salad.

Another aspect is the variety in the unit themselves. The Footman may be colourful, but it can get confusion which side they are on as their armour's colour does not correlate to their team. It makes battles between the same unit confusing and boring, no matter how grand their numbers are. Units really have colours distinguishing their team, otherwise it is only really fun to watch them fight different units.

I think we can agree variety is important in battle sims. Otherwise, we would just be watching the same thing over and over, which is boring! The texture need some variety as well, blood and grass look like checkerboards when viewed from afar. Maps also need more structures and obstacles, otherwise they are the same flat map just with another coat of paint and limits scenario creativity.

The game also has poor UI and game options. I understand it is in Early Access, but I would really like to swap my y-axis camera controls and invert my RTS camera. Tips are also small and their colour blends with the background, making them hard to read. Unit groups are also hard to find on both on map and in battle if they are only in the dozens or hundreds, and teams do not have labels that show what units are in it. There is not even a menu for exiting the battle. The game needs better presentation; at the current state, I find it too simple to be taken seriously.

The RTS is a incredible feature, I can command millions to a specific point smoothly and the units are very responsive! However, it needs tooltips on the command, it is confusing without explanation on hover. In addition, I find it mildly infuriating that the command resets when another group is selected. Units also sometimes stop completely, usually in groups. I suspect it's due to them getting blocked, which suspends their all their order completely, even the initial attack AI. This feature has great potential, it just needs some auto-resume and toggles to make sure no unit becomes idle.

Overall, the game has great potential to surpass every battle simulator in the market, but its features are very bare-boned right now. I do hope the developers read this review and take in my suggestions, I really do have faith in this game and want to see it succeed and become the Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.";1.8;0.0;2.0;19.0;Posted: May 13

I have been waiting for this game for so long. It is amazing. I still can't believe that an indie team like Brilliant Game Studios accomplished some thing like this. I do hope for more maps and god powers though. Like an Omaha beach map from the old UEBS. Also for god powers a blood splatter like they showed in the video. But I don't what to push them too hard.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
Early access is very very unpolished at the moment. The only improvements over UEBS1 are the liquid physics, A.I and performance. Their main selling point is size and performance, they do a hell of a job on that, it runs like a dream. That's about where the complements stop.

As I said the A.I is good, but only when there is literally nothing around them. I found that troops will walk through walls and commit suicide by just walking into the water by the masses. Not only is it immersion breaking when you see 10,000 troops walk through city walls and then plunder themselves into the water, its pretty much game breaking. These problems are what can shift the tides of your battles completely, its the most disappointing part of the game so far.

A few features are gone from the last game as well, some stuff just hasn't been improved. Troop possession is still as basic and boring, no sprint key, no blocking, no charged attack, no jumping, nothing. The Nuke has been removed and you can't split 1 team into smaller groups. Instead you will have to make multiple teams set as ""Team 1"" and distribute them that way.

With all that being said, the game is basically the first game when it very first released, but with some performance and graphics improvements. I really hope the devs keep up with content updates, fixes and improvements because at the moment the game really is not worth it.";0.9;0.0;2.0;249.0;Posted: May 13

After .7hours in the game I have yet to actually have a battle with any troops in it. It seems like some others are able to make battles in this game so either it is very bugged so far or extremely not intuitive. Others seem to be having this issue where no matter what changes the battles load with 0 troops and immediately end. Once I am able to find out how to simulate a battle with more than 0 troops or the game is patched and it becomes more than ultimate epic scenery simulator 2 I will update this.

As someone who never had problems running millions of units in UEBS I this game offers nothing new. It's a copy paste of EUBS I with no new features or any changes where it counts. The thing I was excited most for was hopefully a better UI and better way to setup troops, but instead we're left with the same horribly clunky UI moving blocks of units around resizing them with numerical values and assigning them with drop down menus. Anyone who could run UEBS I who says different is drinking copium. Just play UEBS I if you already have it and can run it.";0.4;0.0;6.0;164.0;Posted: May 12

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I liked UEBS 1 a lot and expected a lot of great features to be added such as Campaign, RTS mode etc.

Now they are launching UEBS 2 and yes they added RTS mode but ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE is REMOVED?? Why? there were hundreds of fun characters, now we have just bare minimum, chiken 1 roman, 1 archer, ww2.. Really boring. Why remove all the characters from UEBS 1 ? I expected this to be upgrade to first one..

Campaign is not there yet.

RTS mode is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥, there are 30 years of RTS games starting Command and Conquer, it's not hard to make good clean RTS mode in 2022, they could do it in 1993 well enough.

Little bit too lazy. Graphics look same as well, very lazy.

Rivers of blood? Not sure i like this addition, from top view all looks like ants are fighting each other in the rivers of blood.

All in All it's early access but boring and disappointed so far. I hope it improves over years but so far looks like the cash grab idea to sell exactly same game as before with LESS features and pretend to improve it by adding old units that were already there in UEBS1..";0.2;0.0;5.0;66.0;Posted: May 13

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
It's more remaster than a proper sequel.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Recommended.
On the fence.


VERSION TIME OF REVIEW: Alpha v0.1
OPTIMIZATION: 100+ FPS on 1440p high with a 2070 RTX
TIME TO BEAT: N/A
SIMILAR GAMES: Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, People Playground, SwarmZ
SIMILAR MOVIES: Avengers, The Hunt, The Purge


Look, I understand its in early access but I cannot recommend it in its current state (Alpha v0.1) and I'm even a bit disappointed that this feels like a cash grab. The graphics, performance, and AI have been slightly improved to where you can run more troops on the map and it looks slightly nicer. THAT'S IT. Everything else is exactly the same as the original. EXACTLY. The menu is exactly the same, the font is exactly the same, there's almost exactly the same units as the original (around 20) and there's 5 maps (some of which are new). Hell even the gameplay is the same - sit back and watch but now you can move units around. I'm kinda shocked that they didn't even reorganize the menu to give you the ""new"" game feeling because it's horribly messy - ""Ancient Greece"", ""Roman Times"", etc. It just feels sloppy. Just go by time periods from a history book (Pre-History, Classic Antiquity, Middle Ages, etc) and use a ""Other"" tab for your fantasy/heroes/animal units.

There's also ""campaign"" mode but it's tabbed out and inaccessible for now. Barely any news on what it entails. The trailer was also misleading - we saw Chuck Norris and John Wick neither of which are playable characters in this game. You can honestly get more content from the original with Workshop right now today than you can from this sequel. So why buy it? If you want to support the developer? Great. If you want a content rich game? Play the original. Again, I understand its in early access but wait for more content to come out first. There's TONS of other fulfilling games on Steam for a fraction of the price. I'll change my review when we get enough content for it to be a proper sequel.";0.6;0.0;0.0;707.0;Posted: May 13

Fun simulator with *massive* battles. A.I. is definitely improved over the original UEBS1. And between possessing units, and RTS-Mode, you can always feel apart of the battle.

200k zombies pour into a city--64 Nikola Teslas pump lightning down the alleyways like Darth Sidious. Eventually rooftops are all that poke out of the body-littered-ground. Nikola Tesla applies their combined-intelligence and navigate the body-hills together, using rooftops to their advantage. With some losses, they manage to conquer the horde atop the mountain of corpses. (rejoice!)

I'm hoping to see:
- More units, and customizations (such as unit speed)
- Steam Workshop, hopefully with custom maps
- ""Groups"" army-variable - divides army's units into different spawn areas
- Game-speed slider from the original
- Elevation of camera with ""spacebar""
- More God powers; the current ones feel all too weak.";1.2;1.0;0.0;372.0;Posted: May 14

I spent about 2 hours watching 25 John Wicks take on an army of one million zombies. They killed so many that the amount of blood they generated caused a local dam to burst it's banks and send a cascade of water down a dusty desert town before creating a crimson lake outside the pyramids where several other zombies drowned. I honestly can't think of another game where this is remotely possible. The only downside to these massive battles is that oftentimes they don't end, usually some units get stuck and can't move or else the pathfinding gets messed up and they all get stuck in the same spot and become unreachable. But I suppose in this case it's the journey that's important.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
The game is very good & has much more possibilities then the original, although there isn't much content at the moment (because its in alpha,) you are able to basically host battles of millions, create blood lakes, large body piles, and do all of this on a low-end computer. It is worth the 17$ right now in my opinion, but you should probably wait a little until they release more content if you're expecting a bunch of units & other things to play with.

Its basically UEBS 1 but everything is completely better, even the graphics, although you might be thinking they could've just added this all to the first game It really isn't like that considering how the game deals with large numbers of units is now completely different, and they also added other things like fluid physics, etc.";13.3;1.0;0.0;64.0;Posted: May 14

This game is way better than Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 1 in the way battles are played out, not a lot of content, but the game just came out so i don't blame them and they already did a patch note which is good. I hope this game does not turn out to be like total tank sim if any of you bought that game, if you have not heard or play it, it just stop updating after a while, its a lot like this game. i hope there keep releasing updates. all in all this game is an 8/10 maybe not buy it yet, wait for more updates come out, but 5 maps, good maps came on release.

I hope they keep working.

At current I do not want to recommend nor do I want to not recommend it. Support it if you are interested. So for now I will put a thumbs up. Just wanted to make that clear.

That being said. This game sucks in current state. Whats the point of very large armies fighting with minimal diversity between units. Not a a lot other than they can say the engine is working well but overall certain aspects need polish. With work and dedication I know more can be achieved. So at current do not expect much more than that. Game play wise it is minimal at current.";0.5;1.0;0.0;284.0;Posted: May 14

The core feature works exactly as advertised: You can simulate a battle of 1 million vs 1 million, and it just works. The maps are pretty cool too. There are obvious bugs, but nothing gamebreaking. The worst is RTS sometimes not selecting a troop, but this game isn't really about RTS.

Overall, it's a fun time. If money's tight, stick with UEBS 1, as it has way more features. But if you've got a few dollars to spare and you only care about the core ""gameplay"", this is more performant, prettier, and just feels a bit better";7.4;1.0;0.0;20.0;Posted: May 14

""Millions off characters? puh... no way that'll work""
>Loads 2m zombies backed up by 50,000 trolls vs a Medieval army 100,000 strong
>FPS over 60""
""Wh-....""

I'm not even going to explain the immense and epic fight that happened.
The AI seems to be not that straightforward, as it didn't neccesarily go to the closest unit, they'd trek 100s of meter to cover a flank on the frontline, or if a new horde of units would be on the way they'd split up their forces to cover that.

Also there's actually a solid fluid system that's surprisingly performance friendly?
As units bleed, blood will trickle down hills and even gather, if the battle are severe enough a pool or even lakes of blood will form, lakes that units can drown in...
In this particular fight, there were footmen drowning literally in their own blood as the pile of corpses that gathers from the incomprehensible number of enemies kept flooding.
Uphill it got so bad when the archers unloaded it on the trolls zombies and a literal blood-tsunami stormed downhill.
Of course you can summon water yourself and cause a flood so big it'll slam into the units killing them and form new lakes that will trickle down wherever its lowest.

The games only weakness right now is the lack of maps and units, but spec wise it has quite the foundation.";11.0;1.0;0.0;446.0;Posted: May 14

Pros:
-El juego cumple lo que mostró, se puede desplegar una gran cantidad de unidades( >4 millones) con una buena cantidad de fps.
-La mecánica de la sangre que se va acumulando hasta formar Ríos y lagos esta bien.
-El modo rts se ve interesante.
Contras:
-La IA tiende a algunas veces a estancarse en un bucle sin lograr llegar a ningún lado.
-Pocas unidades.
-Falta la opción de dividir las tropas en grupos para así simular distintas estrategias de ataque/defensa.

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have been waiting for this game for well over a year and now that it's out I can only describe it as one thing: absolutely impressive in every aspect of the word. I used to think that the first game was incredible (and while it may have it's memories and nostalgia) but even in this games only second day of release I am blown away at how smoothly it operates into the millions of characters on screen at once. yes, there are some minor things that I would like to see improved or patched in the future (ragdolls flying 100ft in the air when you shoot a tank at them, base camera flying speed seems a little slow, not a huge variety of characters to select from, no fast forward option, etc.) but still madly impressive nevertheless. this is an absolute beast of a game, I can't wait to see what the developers have in store for it. great job!";3.1;1.0;0.0;48.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have full confidence that this title will be incredible at full release because it is already amazing! I have to say, the GPU-based unit engine is the most impressive aspect of this game. I was easily able to run OVER A MILLION units at 4k 60+ FPS on max settings with my dated, Titan XP (surprisingly, it was the cheapest, non-potato GPU I could get my hands on last year when my old card finally died). There are bugs and a lack of variety in the content, but this is in alpha! I fully expected this game to have waaaay more issues, but I am happy to report that I only had some minor UI issues when using the RTS mode. Everything else seems to work well! I can't wait for full release and workshop support.

I loved setting up battles using LOTR models in the original UEBS. However, I could only have about 100,000 units on a map in the first game. Now I can easily run TEN TIMES as many on a mid-range GPU. Great work, Brilliant Games Studios!

On the off chance that the developers see this, here are a few suggestions to improve the game by full release:

1. Re-implement the feature from UEBS that allowed us to split armies into multiple stacks. This made setting up battles a little easier for role play and allowed for more fine-tuning of scenarios.
- I understand that the RTS mode eliminates the ~need~ for this system, but it still was nice from an RP perspective.

2. Consider adding a map editor, so that users can make custom scenarios to share on the workshop more easily.
- This may be part of your plans for workshop/ mod support, but I felt the need to suggest it because it was something I sorely missed in the original game.
- I'm not sure how you guys do your nav-meshing and pathing with such a proprietary unit system, so this may be more complicated than most people expect it to be, but I still think it should be something to consider.

3. Add mounted units. I've always wondered why there weren't horsemen in UEBS, but the highlands map in UEBS 2 is practically begging for some Mongol hordes to charge across its plains.

Suggestions aside, I think that this is a great Alpha release. Thankfully, I haven't run into any game-breaking issues, like some people have reported, but I'll just count that as me getting luck for once. As such, I can't complain. $15 well-spent.";9.9;1.0;0.0;127.0;Posted: May 14

EARLY ACCESS REVIEW
I have been a huge fan of Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 1, and just to get it out of the way, I have been LOVING Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2 as of recently. I have always done Large scale Zombie Invasion vs soldier scenarios for 90% of the time I play the game, and I can finally fulfill my dream of millions of zombies on screen against humans on a holdout, without having to worry about having 50k+ zombies lagging the game, causing zombies to bug out, or just the zombie pathways just seeming like they are taking the worst possible path, causing them to clog up especially in hallways, and when they finally start to attack the humans, they only attack single file which really sucked. While UEBS2 has fixed a TON of the issues I had with UEBS1 for that scenario I love doing all the time, I do also wish for some more features as the game gets developed

Pros
-A.I seems WAY smarter now, they actually flank, choose paths that would cause way more issues for the enemy team which is exciting, and they actually know how to engage as a group instead of UEBS1 where they seem to get stuck on each other.
-RTS controls allows for more interactivity and is overall a huge improvement, even tho the RTS feature is kinda simple and limited, so more complex controls would be nice
- Projectile system for bullets and the blood system makes battles feel WAY more impactful, I love watching the zombies fly around everywhere
-Zombie Pileups are way more functional and not a buggy mess like uebs1 (thank god)

Cons
- Need more Zombie models to work with, a ton of my zombie variations look too much the same (fast zombie vs slow strong zombie), so for some of my variations they are just normal looking humans which kinda blows
-Gibs would be nice but idk how that would work
-sometimes I notice that zombies start to get lost for their pathway, so they end up just standing on a road, blocking all the zombies trying to get to the humans which blows
-Buff the God Powers, the shotgun one kinda sucks and I want a variation of the flood power which DROWNS the map, kinda takes too long to make scenarios I want.
-New, smaller but more complex maps that allow holdouts, my favorite map so far is the mountain but I would like variation, which would be fixed by the workshop

Overall UEBS2 is going in the right direction and I can't wait for the next updates, especially campaign and workshop. Other then that do add more zombie models for now that I could work with like the old zombie model from before just so I can spice up the zombie models more.";14.5;1.0;0.0;127.0;Posted: May 14

It may only be in Early access but boy does it look good and feel good. It's got a great start with some amazing huge maps for people who have the ability to do millions of troops. It's so much of an upgrade from the first, allowing for more than 10x the units while still having little to no lag, unlike in UEBS I where you could have 50,000 and it'd be around 20-30 FPS instead of 45-60 like now. The animations, graphics, design, and units are of a much higher detail and effort, and it adds a lot more to the game than most would think. Overall it's a great experience, and truly leaves a lot for even more expansion for it's already amazing foundation.";10.7;1.0;0.0;53.0;Posted: May 14

A complete survival game, with all features that can be expected from such a game.

This is a first impression review. I let a friend and my sun play this, because I can't myself due to a handicap.

Stranded naked
You start the game waking up on a beach with nothing but a crude stone. You can smash the stone into trees or rocks to instantly receive the appropriate resources. With those you can craft tools, weapons and a base in order to survive. There are primary needs, such as hunger and thirst to overcome, but also other players and wild animals that have a grudge against you. Survival game 101, they pretty much all function this way.

Whether or not this game is in particular the survival game to play, comes down to a few factors.
- Friends. If played with friends, any game is infinitely more fun!
- personal preference.
- the game population. At moment of writing there are 88000 players playing. In Rust you need other players.

My views of this game are very limited, as I haven't spent hundreds of hours in it. It looks good, but it seems a very basic survival game. The one remarkable thing I noticed was the unearthly long loading times! I haven't seen loading times of several minutes in well over a decade ago, and I think it's a huge problem of this game.

This game is nothing like I've ever played. I wake up for this 9-5 job that I've subjected myself to. it's terrible but I can't bring myself to let it go. (Like Elsa from frozen) I've been playing for over 20 hours and I haven't been able to walk around let alone collect resources for a base before some twink with a bow shows up behind me (like that teleports behind you meme) and adds an extra hole in my chrome dome for him to skull ♥♥♥♥ me with. My God I cant stop playing this game for the rush of dopeamean that it gives me when I murder a naked for no reason while he unexpectedly gathers resources for his ""own"" base, soon to be my new crib because he was too focused collecting stone for me. (he just didn't know it was mine yet). I would play this game for another 40 hours before installing cheats or hiring some wack 40-year-old to do everything for me so i can collet my loot form you soon to be demolished base. 10/10 would buy again.";37.7;1.0;2.0;31.0;Posted: May 11

I am one of the grandfathers of this game and I only have 4k hours.
I remember back when my father (helk) was putting out fresh new updates every week. What a time to be alive. Good ol days of no bag timers, picking up someone in less than a second, and the screams of downed players.
I bought this amazing game for 10 dollas back in the 1800s. Today I stand 5'5"" as a woman which sucks ♥♥♥♥ because she has less loot spots that men in this game have.
Overall good game 10/10

My soul got crushed when the base I spent hours on got destroyed. I can't come back to this, but I should've known what I was getting into beforehand. If you're the type, like me, who doesn't like losing progress. This is not for you. I think it gave me PTSD, man. At the very least, I learned a genre of crafting/survival that I do not like.
However, it is probably suitable for people who do enjoy survival PVP.";7.1;0.0;0.0;73.0;Posted: May 14

First of all. This review is based on my low playtime.
The idea of what rust can and could have been is good.
It's the current playerbase who turned this review the way it did.

Like I said. The game mechanics, idea and execution actually is super cool. However as a new player you don't get a good first impression. Let me explain:
So I loaded up the game with a friend of mine. I spawn on a beach and start running clueless around smashing trees and rocks. After a couple minutes I figured out how to build a tiny ♥♥♥♥.. I mean shed.
I go back outside to try to find my friend. At this point another player runs up to me. I say ""Hey I'm friendly, I'm new to the game"" he then replies ""♥♥♥♥ you (Insert 3x racist words here)"" and proceeds to scream and play racist songs through his mic as he kills me.
First I think that I was just unlucky to have met one bad person. I soon found out that ~80% of the players are like that.

Generally super toxic and unfriendly community. I left the game feeling annoyed more that happy(Which is what I'd like to feel after playing a game). Which resulted in me uninstalling the game and I've not touched it since.
Now some people may reply to this saying that this is just how this type of game genre is.
But I can say it's not. I've played SCUM, Unturned, DayZ ETC. And yes they had toxic people as well. But it was a much nicer experience as a new player to play those games over Rust.

COD has a nicer community.";3.7;0.0;0.0;118.0;Posted: May 12

If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.";93.7;1.0;0.0;135.0;Posted: May 12

With the changed regional price in Russia (which is unreasonably extremely inflated: was 800 rubles, now it's 3000)
I can now state only one thing.

It is now cheaper to spend a night with all the developers' mothers than to buy this damned game (you'll also have 3000 rubles to spare after that)

This games is the most dreadful gaming experience i have had in my life. Totally not worth 40 euros, i give this game 15 euros max. The game is just solely grinding unless you are in a pvp server. And not to talk for the community, the most toxic, racist and homophobic people that I've ever encountered. The gameplay basic and repeating. Totally not recommending this game.";14.0;0.0;0.0;82.0;Posted: May 8

Do not listen to that noob's review He throws fits and threw a huge one when he burnt meat. The optimization was due to a server not the game. It was a build heavy server that had lots of Role play and items.
If you play a regular server the game is awesome. I have a potato computer and play just fine and adjust my game play when on heavy servers for Role Play.";558.3;1.0;0.0;5.0;Posted: May 8

I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.";879.2;1.0;0.0;67.0;Posted: May 7

Ever since Counter-Strike: Condition Zero I have loved this game. So far I believe this is best first-person-shooter game. It is easier to get accustom to game formats and controls compared to other FPS games. Although easy to get introduce, the learning curve for this game is extremely challenging if you want to get better. If you play this game for social and casual purpose then you would love it.

If you plan to swim in competitive format, then Valve (company) does terrible job in detecting Cheaters, Smurfs and Trolls in this game.";2092.7;1.0;1.0;6.0;Posted: May 12

A solid professional e-sports choice. As a rookie 1.6 player, this was a welcome surprise. The weapons handle extremely well. The best experience for me was learning from the pros and getting better. The bullet spray is fun to learn and practice. Great matchmaking experience! Death-matches and 5v5s are equally fun to play. Although it would need some time to rank up and/or buy Prime Status Upgrade to separate yourself from the cheaters. There are many other game modes but I only care about becoming better at 5v5 matches. My favorite weapons are M4A4, MP7, MP9, Five-SeveN, P250 and of course AWP.

Other than that, I am not a fan of its art; characters and environment. It focuses on being realistic and looks bland and uninteresting, especially the terrorist team. They could have upped the art direction and could have taken notes from productions like Mad Max the movie, The Book of Eli etc. while maintaining the visibility required for fair play.";319.4;1.0;1.0;85.0;Posted: May 11
