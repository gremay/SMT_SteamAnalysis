2;For The Warp;l 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW It has the feel of FTL but plays similar to slay the spire The biggest turnoff for me and what ended up causing me to refund it is that you dont draw from your deck Every turn you get 5 random cards out of the cards in your deck you could get the same hand over and over it does not cycle through all the cards For example In my 21 card deck I had one copy of a card that boosts the attack of all your active drones and 3 cards that made drones In one battle and the battles are decently lengthy I drew the drone boost card every turn but never once did I draw a card that made a drone It was very frustrating In addition energy is not saved between turns but shields are there is a shield capacity so you can have totally wasted turns where you draw mostly shields and your shields are already at max so the turn just gets wasted  In short I enjoyed FTL and slay the spire but found this to be more frustrating than fun;0.5;0.0;78.0;1004.0;08 April, 2020;973
3;For The Warp;uary 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is a tentative recommendation Like many others have said the game is fun but some things just dont work as youd expect Its less a deck-builder and more a card pool-builder - you have discard & draw mechanics but cards dont play in any sort of deck order You can draw the same card in every hand and never see others even over many turns The ability to explore sectors is cool but its not very useful and can encourage you to time-waste Having played this I can understand why FTL has an enemy fleet chasing you Its quite possible to become self-sufficient gaining fuel with every battle & self-repairing and clean out an entire sector but theres little value to doing so - youll have loads of money without anything useful to spend it on and just see the same two groups of enemies over and over;36.3;1.0;15.0;693.0;10 January, 2021;853
4;For The Warp;uary EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Ultimately disappointing Listen to other popular negative comments Theyre right  This game struggles from extreme balancing issues I wouldnt even bother picking this up until theyre fixed if they ever are The drone carrier which seems like a super fun ship cant even get passed the first few battles in Hardcore because you cant keep your drones alive Basic issues like that stop this game from going up in the ranks of STS type games Art is super awesome at least  I also experienced an invincibility bug that made every enemy permanently miss me Got to see the whole game for free and unlocked everything  PS My time played is way off I think Im closer to around 10-12 hours;26.4;0.0;18.0;937.0;18 January, 2022;724
7;For The Warp;st 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Like other reviews have said the draw mechanic is nonsensical You dont draw a card from the top you draw it from a pool So you can miss a card again and again and redraw cards immediately after playing them  Finished the game on my second run using an infinite loop of gattling fire Got nothing for it Hardcore didnt even unlock Game is really basic and lacks anything to set it apart from others Art is pretty nice the theme is good Ran into several bugs  Play Monster Train instead;1.7;0.0;30.0;489.0;05 August, 2020;527
9;For The Warp;l FTW doesnt have much of a story If any story It is lacking in ways to make the playable ships different All ships draw from the same card pool  The boss fights are just a big bag of health points Even the final fight is no different to all the fights that came before  With a name like FTW it is going to be compared to FTL And FTL is better in every way FTW could have learnt a LOT from them especially about story;18.6;0.0;12.0;462.0;06 April, 2022;428
10;For The Warp;r 24 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The concept is great and it is fun for a little while but it gets old VERY fast  There is much better rogue lite deckbuilders out there for similar prices;0.4;0.0;21.0;499.0;24 October, 2021;188
11;For The Warp;ry 22 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Cant immediately quit and restart a new run easily Instead forced to sit through laggy menus and scenes everytime Im going to re-roll those initial selections A LOT so Id rather not waste my time Everything else is slow too with no speed-up option Why does everything take so long Why cant I click past events  You only get 3 maybe 5 trinkets max so theres no going crazy with those Most cards seem weak except for some really busted ones Deck is reshuffled every turn with no discard pile Better to cull your deck than build one and wait for one of the busted cards Prices at the shops seem all over the place Value in general seems could use some reconsidering  Also buggy with events just not working sometimes forcing restarts  Some weird choices that make it more frustrating than fun;21.5;0.0;9.0;284.0;22 February, 2022;845
12;For The Warp;ry 7 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is far too barebones currently There is no real meaningfull synergy The best way to beat the game is to simply remove cards from your starting deck so that you can fill it with cards that cost 0 and draws 1 It has cards that are too strong like reversing all enemy intents for 0 energy It becomes more of a war of how much time do you wish to spend on the save rather than how great of play do you do and how interesting of a deck you can build and due to that there are never any exciting moments where you live on a sliver of health You can tell from the first three battles if this run will be worth doing or not Its not totally meaningless but it would need quite the rehaul to make it worth playing more than once let alone pay for it;7.1;0.0;8.0;122.0;07 February, 2021;787
13;For The Warp;28 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Ever played Slay the Spire but felt it needed more spaceships  Say no more For the Warp has you covered This deckbuilding game takes everything you love and potentially hate about these card game RPGs and blasts it right into space You explore systems have some friendly and not so friendly encounters wholl all throw cards your way faster than you can jump to warp speed;4.6;1.0;21.0;416.0;28 March, 2020;410
14;For The Warp;12 Misses out on a lot of what makes deckbuilders like slay the spire fun Poorly balanced cards and repetitive encounters make this game not very enjoyable There are also a lot of poor design decisions like the ability to pool shield between turns and the lack of scaling damage over time that incentivises the player to play in the most boring way possible Stack as much shield as possible every turn then spend remaining energy on attack cards with little to no regard for what the enemies are doing;7.2;0.0;7.0;60.0;12 April, 2022;508
15;For The Warp;6 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun little game for 4 hours Worth a play on offer  Completed it within that time though and after that there isnt much to make me want to play more  It doesnt have the re-playablity allure that FTL had for different runs / decks and unlocks;3.8;0.0;9.0;490.0;16 July, 2021;274
18;For The Warp;4 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Game is short and rather shallow Only 3 ships and 5 levels at this stage  Update 4 ships and 6 levels I dont hate this game and will continue to play and update reviews Still not recommended at this stage;8.6;0.0;8.0;167.0;14 July, 2020;240
19;For The Warp;6 Like other negative reviews power scaling is strange and basic survival past the first round or two seems to be based on luck if you get shield capacity and energy The battles are long and enemies are mostly uninteresting You just slug away at each other taking turns recharging shields and taking shots For the price I think there are many other better deck builders but its not awful The art and theme are very well done;10.5;0.0;7.0;441.0;06 April, 2022;432
20;For The Warp;8 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW its really plan and simple for a rouge like in its current state this is a no from me but who knows it might be better in the future;3.8;0.0;12.0;567.0;18 July, 2021;163
22;For The Warp;29 I thought theyd fix the problems the game had in early access They didnt Poor game balance primarily;6.4;0.0;8.0;278.0;29 March, 2022;109
23;For The Warp;er 13 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Yes the game could do with more balancing and variety of events but the core gameplay is solid fun and recommended Looking forward to seeing it progress out of Alpha and improve even more;57.1;1.0;4.0;13.0;13 December, 2021;224
24;For The Warp; 21 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For the Warp is like many Roguelike Deck builders but not the addictive properties of games like Slay the Spire By no means is FtW a bad game In this Early Access the game is solid I think Ive only experienced one bug and could not replicate it My ship that just disappeared and could not move Cards and interactions with enemies are what you expect Theyre balanced I think Ive cleared three runs out of my ten Onto their Draft One of the best things is its auto unlocked For those of us who love sealed and drafts Devs great job  Unfortunately there doesnt seem to be a large card pool While each ship starts off with a different deck of cards Each ship can branch out and do something the others can With such a small card pool decks do feel rather similar I hope as time goes on more cards are added Overall I would recommend this game;6.9;1.0;4.0;265.0;21 August, 2021;904
25;For The Warp;0 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW its extremely broken and nearly unplayable graphics settings dont work no settings stay after closing the game it doesnt save or saves just before the end of a previous run but not the one i was just doing a lot of the cards just dont do anything text boxes and overlays and graphics either dont display or are stuck on the screen and stops any progression combined with the saving issue makes it an ironman run every time with the chance of finding a new card that does nothing and thatll clutter the small deck and kill you  Theres promise but Its very far from being worth the 15 bucks or the frustration of the experience it needs a lot of work before its ready;26.7;0.0;7.0;123.0;30 July, 2020;702
26;For The Warp;2 Really nice on the surface concept artstyle musicthe first few runs are really fun  I really wish I could give a reccomendation but its very unbalanced and repetitve If you get the right aka broken combinations of cards/upgrades at the beginning easy win Or you dont then its almost a guaranteed loss  Also some qol improvements would be really nice clear indicators for active powerups or status effects support for 219 resolutions etc  Changes from the early access version are almost not noticable except the new cards Would love to love it but cant as it is right now;17.1;0.0;5.0;111.0;02 April, 2022;602
27;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game is a very fun roguelike space exploration deckbuilding card-fighter think FTL meets Slay the Spire  I have noticed it tends to lag during combat but its an Alpha so I suppose its to be expected I hope it gets fixed soon though  Also having some animations when a card is played discarded etc would be nice;8.6;1.0;10.0;177.0;27 March, 2020;354
29;For The Warp;6 The game is ok but the total randomness of the cards really detracts Starting a new game with the basic cards becomes a total luck fest on if you meet one or 3 ships If you encounter multiple 3 ship groups in a row you just plain lose The damage output balance is very weak It feels like a beta game Drafting is cool but way over powered compared to the base decks;63.2;0.0;5.0;70.0;06 April, 2022;374
30;For The Warp;ry 26 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I love the art style and design of the game I have beaten the game on hardcore and draft with every ship The game in its current state is very minimalistic Each run through you need to eliminate most of the starter cards Mass Driver is essential for every single deck this card needs to have a chance to be permanently destroyed each time it is used I can make perfect draw decks with Mass Driver The game is very easy simply by getting a few heal cards and getting as many +to max shield cards What the game lacks most is meaningful interactions with aliens They need to hire some cartoonists or comic strip writers to make some satirical and fun interactions with aliens The game is too easy I can gauranteed win every single run through by farming a zone This game needs to take a note from Slay the Spire and Hades by adding some scaling difficulty modifiers to keep players challenged and interested I do recommend this game but many updates need to come;120.3;1.0;3.0;130.0;26 February, 2021;1006
31;For The Warp; 17 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Way too short and its not just for the game being in Early Access I dont see much that could be put into this This game has great mechanics card creation kinda nice map movement although its not my favorite but what bothers me most is time you can play it Taking similar titles like Faster than light or Into the Breach they give you much more replay-ability Not taking into considaration Slay the Spire which Im not going to say this game is based on but is in similar style yet it makes you play over and over again  Overall Very nice game but price - play-time ratio is not worth it I really wish Im wrong here and devs have some ways like better campain in plan I would really look forward that;3.3;0.0;3.0;72.0;17 August, 2020;745
32;For The Warp;er 17 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For the warp is awesome  the team has a lot of future additions planned but even as it is its a solid game every playthrough is different and interesting  the artwork is awesome im a sucker for pixel graphics and this game sports some of the best  im 60 hours in and im sure ill still feel as enthusiastic about this game in another 60 hours  if you love turn based games if you love pixel art if you love space  buy this its worth every cent and we need to throw as much money as we can to the devs Massive Galaxy so that they can continue to make games as awesome as this one  in fact if you even got as far as reading this review then you already know that you want this game  buy it;111.5;1.0;3.0;177.0;17 November, 2020;737
33;For The Warp;3 This game is a -HUGE- slog  Enemies have so much hp and the gameplay is so incredibly dull and unengaging that I could never recommend this to someone;4.2;0.0;6.0;1042.0;03 April, 2022;154
34;For The Warp;2 Just far too little content too few cards just boring;3.1;0.0;3.0;396.0;02 April, 2022;57
35;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW What an absolute gem of a game Followed this and played on some shows here in Portugal and also got the Itchio version Finally get to play the final version here on Steam;0.7;1.0;7.0;99.0;27 March, 2020;203
36;For The Warp;ry 9 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This still feels like its in early access and could use some work before its set At the moment the controls are a little clunky in terms of needing to use multiple clicks to do actions Most of the cards you get also just dont see to offer that much opportunity for synergy - theyre just small numbers boosts a lot of the time The idea has potential overall and its possible a future version will make notable improvements but its currently hard to recommend over the other deck-builder games available on Steam;2.5;0.0;5.0;919.0;09 February, 2021;555
38;For The Warp;y 9 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is a seriously underrated game I have played it through almost 20 times and it still doesnt get boring MY favorite feature is the second hidden system ;206.8;1.0;4.0;9.0;09 January, 2022;185
39;For The Warp;2 Problems with the game so far 1 The basic ship balance is not there nothing comes even close to the secret ship 2 No upgrades to cards and no balance either 3 Too short for a release version 4 Bugs out should be in Beta;22.1;0.0;2.0;200.0;02 April, 2022;232
40;For The Warp;31 Shallowly fun but little depth Some card combinations are straight up broken and now everything except that feels bad to me  Also VERY repetitive;15.8;0.0;2.0;158.0;31 March, 2022;151
41;For The Warp;10 got released and I couldnt even tell what was new Super unfinished;31.0;0.0;1.0;82.0;03 May, 2022;72
42;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Not too shabby for being early access  Picture a space-fairing version of Slay the Spire but without as much content or variation Since this is the absolutely bare-bones first release of this game in EA Ill say that theres enough here to make me look forward to the progress the devs make and the certainly the final product  Standard card-adventure fare Start with 3 energy use a combo of block attack and status cards blow up ships and move around a map in search of treasure or death Nice art style nice music  I think this should be 10 bucks 15 bucks for the full product would be fine but this is EA and while fun the game is still limited in scope  If you like supporting devs and like card-based games its worth your time If youre in zero rush for something new to check out you might want to see how often it gets updated before you toss down your money;35.7;1.0;4.0;964.0;27 March, 2020;917
43;For The Warp;9 I enjoyed this game quite a bit enough to play for 30 hours but I really wish there was more meta progression and more content Ships and difficulty modes are the only unlocks and I feel it would be much more engaging/addictive if there was something more to unlock such as different cards or bonuses The atmosphere is good and I enjoyed the music and art style for what it is I did think the giant FTW after every battle was kind of childish and annoying but I got used to it eventually Id like to see some different enemies as on some maps I felt like I was just fighting the same three enemies on every battle yawn The RNG didnt bother me as much as some other people I felt it added a layer of strategy and use for the hand-manipulating cards I also liked that you could save mid-run All in all if you enjoy roguelike deckbuilders and a space setting youll probably have fun with this one for a little while;32.1;1.0;1.0;522.0;09 April, 2022;940
44;For The Warp;7 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Ive been having a lot of fun with FTW Theres definite stylistic comparisons that can be drawn between FTW and FTL with influence from Slay the Spire but its a standalone game Given that its a Rogue-like-like it can have some randomness problems but is overall pretty well balanced There isnt much of a story at this time but as of this writing alpha 061 its very early in its development Looking forward to a much greater variety of content including encounters enemies and music Looking forward to continued growth and evolution check it out;15.9;1.0;2.0;1207.0;07 April, 2020;592
45;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW FTL meets Hearthstone  Gorgeous pixel art Great music Good Sci-Fi Fun game  Still early days but this shows a lot of promise The menus and interactions can use some love but the core of the game is strong and has a great foundation to grow  Already getting that ONE MORE TURN crave every time Im on a roll and am obliterated  *UPDATE*  Over 10 hours in and the game keeps getting better The new ships systems and cards change things up significantly;13.1;1.0;6.0;336.0;27 March, 2020;493
48;For The Warp;r 31 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game kicked actual arse Best thing I have played in a long while If you dig FTL and Slay the Spire then get this You wont regret it The art work is stellar and the game play feels so slick Aim for decent energy and defence and you will feel like a natural born killer Still challenging though So stoked to see it develop Huge thanks to the devs You folks are killing it Bravo;44.2;1.0;3.0;401.0;31 October, 2020;423
49;For The Warp;29 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Guide a Rogue Trader hurtling through space in this deck-builder Card-driven FTL combat only no crew or ship management so its very streamlined and accessible Fun but well see how it develops  Please follow my curator page Designer Plays for a truly massive number of concise and honest reviews from a 25-year veteran Game Designer;1.4;1.0;3.0;17096.0;29 March, 2020;371
50;For The Warp;0 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Great game still not the full release version but Im really enjoying my time with it cant wait to see what else gets added;12.9;1.0;1.0;463.0;20 July, 2020;154
51;For The Warp;6 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW FTL meets slay the spire loving it hope to see a lot more ships and systems in the future cant wait;20.2;1.0;1.0;21.0;16 July, 2020;130
52;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Already engaging and fun to play The pixel art is really great and what gets your attention right away Despite being in Eearly access I didnt notice any issues and one that I had specific to my machine configuration the developer was fast to fix;1.2;1.0;3.0;437.0;27 March, 2020;279
54;For The Warp;5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very impressive early access game A very good challenge with some new twists from the average deckbuilder theres no discard pile for one which means every card in your deck has an equal chance of being selected each turn This might mean your big card is in your hand every turn or you never see it throughout a combat or anywhere in between The only minor issues Ive seen are slightly overpowered bosses early in the game and a risk-reward movement system that doesnt quite do what its intended to do but the developer is on the message boards and talks to his players so hopefully some of these things will get ironed out over time Honestly one of the best early access games Ive ever played on Steam and I have every reason to believe it will only get better with time Well worth your hard-earned to support what I hope will be a very well received final version;51.6;1.0;1.0;309.0;05 April, 2020;909
58;For The Warp;y 26 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 2 hours were quite enough to give it few runs to see all the meat Its a nice concept but many aspects of it still requires quite much polish More like no than yes wish there was a neutral option on steam for review system;1.5;0.0;2.0;581.0;26 January, 2021;263
60;For The Warp;29 The game-play is pretty boring for now 5 hours to kill all bosses with second ship on Normal mode and 90% of the time there were repetitive boring fights I expected more variety;5.9;0.0;3.0;101.0;29 March, 2022;183
61;For The Warp;27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Awesome game makes me think of Out There with Monster Slayers like combat Im enjoying it a lot;8.3;1.0;3.0;766.0;27 March, 2020;127
62;For The Warp;22 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is extremely fun even for me someone who is new to this genre The cards in this game are pretty broken so its really fun just to destroy your enemies Most of the ships you can get are pretty fair too and expressive My only issue is the last ships deck being drones and shields While I understand its suppose to be a defensive play style it low hull makes it hard to tank attacks even if the deck does give you a lot of shield card I would probably buff the shield cards but its not a big deal Overall a fun game with crucial decision making wits and rng;15.5;1.0;1.0;119.0;22 April, 2020;612
63;For The Warp;30 Terrible game dont buy it It seems like a mix of Slay the Spire and FTL but with only the worst parts of both games - Tedious and boring fights you are limited to about 2 types of encounters per region which repeats for about 5 to 10 times per region On top of that All enemies are essentially the same with different stats as they largely have the same attack moves - Pointsless events the best part of FTl and Slay the Spire was to step on those question mark tiles and not knowing what to expect In this game 9 out of 10 times is you get some fuel/ cash or sell/scrap a card for cash - Ships that you unlock are the same just with different starting stats and starting deck Making progression meaning less - The equipments that you can find are about as basic as it gets;7.4;0.0;5.0;92.0;30 March, 2022;791
65;For The Warp;y 9 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW fine game needs more enemy types;8.3;1.0;1.0;391.0;09 January, 2022;57
66;For The Warp;1 This is a tentative thumbs down Beat the game on my second or third run when I realized you sometimes just get an amazing equipment like permanent +1 energy right at the start of the game and its essentially a free win Lots of unbalanced cards and strange design decisions doesnt quite have the replay factor or the alternatives Slay the Spire Monster Train heck even FTL Fun quick little game with quite a few cards which surprised me but no balance or satisfaction for a lot of events Very repetitive I love the art style but the execution is bland Id probably rate this a 65 or 7 out of 10 at the moment;9.2;0.0;1.0;155.0;01 April, 2022;628
67;For The Warp;17 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun little alpha game basically FTL meets Slay The Spire with great pixel graphics Still not bored after a few runs looking forward to watching it grow;9.6;1.0;1.0;179.0;17 April, 2020;184
68;For The Warp;7 2020 Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Refreshing to see another Pixel Sci-Fi game Rouge like elements are a lot of fun and I was really into it Made for a good stream   Surprisingly complex and a lot of replayability;3.1;1.0;1.0;873.0;07 April, 2020;239
69;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like card games that throws balance out of the equation because its single player this games got it all Abuse the game mechanics make tiny decks make one turn kill decks make first turn kill deck make combos that ramp damage to 4 digits no run is the same and they hardly ever turn out the way you want fun times cant wait to see more content;56.7;1.0;1.0;67.0;05 July, 2021;387
70;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Like the little brother of Slay the Spire and FTL If you like one of these you will also like this The pixel art is nice the hard combos are fun and the gameplay is very fluid with clear UI and nice feedback The game just has a pleasant rhythm and addicting nature Sometimes the runs are hard sometimes you manage to build you overpowered combo both are rewarding Right now the content is still less than FTL and StS but both these game are unusual for the replayability I easily played 10h more than shown here one Steam and still will play more Great game overall;41.7;1.0;1.0;392.0;06 May, 2021;607
71;For The Warp;25 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Unfortunately have to leave a negative review for this I like the premise having some elements of FTL but its extremely odd to have a deckbuilder have a draw mechanic like this one drawing from the whole deck every turn rather than a discard pile If they changed this I could see the game being a lot better but its restrictive and abusable and makes me think the game has little longevity In my brief time it also seems like it could do with a little more variety in its events and enemies Its a refund for now but still a chance in the future to be a good one with due care;0.4;0.0;3.0;218.0;25 April, 2021;616

75;For The Warp;er 23 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is super fun if you like strategy and puzzle deck based games this game is all about the risk vs reward Sometimes you get in a situation where you have ZERO chance of winning but it is still early in development and its part of the fun;26.1;1.0;2.0;4.0;23 December, 2020;283
77;For The Warp;ry 19 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW with each update the game gets harder and harder to the point if you dont get a heal card at the start even on normal you will lose your taking away any options for the game with less healing or shields;51.3;0.0;5.0;318.0;19 February, 2021;236

86;For The Warp;29 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Game is nice concept but feels like aplha becuse it is aplha  Cards need to be balanced and mechanic making the game more dificult should be put in the combat interface in quite unredable its hard to understand what debuff i have and things like that It is a promising alpha;0.9;1.0;1.0;82.0;29 March, 2020;311
88;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very fun game I had this one on my wish list for a while and waited too long to pull the trigger Vivid art and music make this game just a joy to play More to come as I get more play time;38.4;1.0;0.0;244.0;07 May, 2021;217
89;For The Warp; 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Yes I am not normally a deck builder fan but this one wins my only real grip is there are only three ships to play as as far as I know Okay now there are more ships and some of the new additions to the card types are really fun Although I still think prime defence and syphon drone are essential early game;91.8;1.0;0.0;318.0;16 May, 2020;340

92;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Its an intriguing entry in the card-battle genre but I was disappointed to beat it on the first try I had a card that gave shields and HP for just 1 energy and doesnt get removed from your deck so I was basically invulnerable  In general it doesnt feel like much effort has been spent on card balance Id recommend getting Slay the Spire Monster Train or Griftlands instead;2.8;0.0;2.0;348.0;12 May, 2021;413
93;For The Warp;0 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is good as is and has potential to be even better  Mechanics are very similar to Slay the Spire Theme is pretty great and looks like the story might have some heavy background as they continue working on it  If you are willing to take a gamble or just really like the concept it is probably worth getting even if it isnt on sale;5.4;1.0;0.0;227.0;30 June, 2021;374
94;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A fun game mixing Slay the Spire fight and Into the breach map mechanics in space with great potential what do you want more A bit more variety to enemies could help maybe a bit more to the story maybe greater difference between the ships to choose from though Nonetheless one of the greater early access rough-like titles out there right now which already brought my about 7 hours of very nice gaming experience so far I am curious about what else will come down the development roadmap;9.1;1.0;0.0;152.0;24 May, 2021;522
95;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For The Warp  Addictive turn based gameplay in a sci-fi setting that is randomized  lovely pixelated artstyle  + fitting soundtrack > winning combination ;77.8;1.0;0.0;668.0;12 May, 2021;187
96;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This has A LOT of potential I like the style and art a lot the gameplay is FTL meets Slay the Spire or any other deckbuilder basically Its fun so far but definitely needs balancing and a lot of work As its early access Im hopeful itll be a great game Im glad I picked it up;0.6;1.0;0.0;1880.0;05 May, 2021;312
99;For The Warp; 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I found this game to be quite addictive right off the bat Theres not a lot of great science fiction themed card games out there but this one is almost certainly going to be at the top of that list when its done;0.5;1.0;0.0;505.0;03 July, 2020;241
100;For The Warp; 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Played the hell out of the demo enjoyed it Bought the game when it was released in Early Access Found the card Mass Driver which let me thin my deck down to 2 cards - Barrel Roll and Last Resort Wiped out the last two sectors without taking any damage at all The last boss set me on fire once and made me draw one fewer card once which allowed him to hit me for 7 hp  Overall the game is enjoyable but completely unbalanced - long way to go before final release  Im gonna try the hardcore mode but i dont expect much out of it - itll probably have tougher enemies so itll be more difficult for me to assemble a dominating build but the fundamental flaw of plain vanilla game mechanics isnt going anywhere  Also all the enemies are the same just different skins and stats nothing interesting - seen one seen em all  I enjoyed the game for a couple evenings But devs please make it more balanced diverse and overall more interesting;2.9;1.0;0.0;352.0;23 May, 2020;980
101;For The Warp;30 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 2 things before we begin 1st even though this is a negative review i still enjoy the game and will probably change this review after a few patches 2nd This is the edited version  This game is far to RNG heavy and i think it could be fixed with 1 of 2 things Either give us the power to build a deck by removing or adding cards to your deck even if it is just at the start of the sector Or give us a bigger choice of cards at the start of each Sector My reason for this is simple they is no way of forming a complete build besides random luck  All that said I did have fun playing and will keep playing but I suggest you wait for a few patches to come out before you buy the game;11.3;0.0;2.0;306.0;30 March, 2020;718

109;For The Warp;9 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Disappointing Some builds of the game I couldnt even play because of technical issues aspect ratio/screen region problems couldnt detect inputs etc but beyond that the game design has very large flaws There is no disincentive for going to every single square and fighting every single enemy which makes the entire experience involve no meaningful decision making and having it be extremely tedious and boring There are large balance issues with certain cards being much too efficient and easy to consistently draw due to deck size Pass;2.9;0.0;1.0;85.0;29 June, 2021;576

118;For The Warp;2 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game has the most  for brains UI design Ive ever seen You can easily reject rewards by mistake by having your mouse too close to the skip button found a mythic card  you You were 1 pixel too far right  Design flaws like that are indicative that a developer is either clueless and has never worked in any real professional capacity or that they just dont care;7.7;0.0;3.0;83.0;02 April, 2021;409
119;For The Warp;19 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This needs a good deal of work It has a lot of promise but being so close to release and still so buggy and looking so fuzzy/hazy at times This feels like a mobile game that is getting tested first through Steam and feels like it at times The aesthetic is nice but even slay the spire has better/smoother animations Also doesnt bug out as much and lose you cards/money/etc Ill have to check it out again after release to see if it fixed itself or is mostly aesthetic knockoff of a mobile-but-only-pc slay the spire;0.9;0.0;1.0;136.0;19 April, 2021;553

125;For The Warp;5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Follow our curator for similar games https//storesteampoweredcom/curator/35180752-3-point-play/  Space themed Slay the Spire + challenging + replayability = EA roguelike deckbuilding using 1 of 3 ships to reach portal Encounter stations ruins friendlies and enemies with rewards Great game;1.8;1.0;6.0;2967.0;05 April, 2020;325
126;For The Warp;27 Not as good as some of the card rougelights out there but still not terrible  Has a lot of annoying little bugs though Cards not doing what they say No display for your ship about status effects  The deck building also needs another balance pass Some cards are just not any good;12.0;1.0;0.0;519.0;27 April, 2022;287
128;For The Warp;12 Nice artwork nice tunes The only truly negative thing I can say about the game is its overreliance on RNG I get its meant to be a roguelike but the balance or lack thereof is all over the place I cant begin to tell you the number of runs ended in the first sector because of several clusters of enemies that all spam their attacks and leave you at half or less health past the first encounter then the sector one enemies that enjoy their 10 ~ 23 damage attacks  Yes enemy attack values vary wildly unlike yours which are static Their Burn damage also pierces/ignores your Shields/Block while yours cant do the same  That said its still entertaining for what it is but if the talk about its balancing or lack of certain elements common to deckbuilders of this kind puts you off Id suggest waiting for a sale or watching someone else play it before deciding;9.8;1.0;0.0;701.0;12 April, 2022;881

133;For The Warp;1 Its not bad Its a bit RNG heavy and bit light on content but it isnt overly expensive The pixel art and general gameplay mechanics are good A bit of fleshing out and variety in both fights and encounters would help along with a bit less of the aforementioned RNG The fuel mechanic is kind of whatever if you have a good deck;9.9;1.0;0.0;262.0;01 April, 2022;336
135;For The Warp;31 This game reminds me of the good times I had in Slay the Spire If you like deckbuilding this is a great game for you Spire was the first game that got me into deckbuilding but it felt too rigid and linear This one gives a lot more path choices and as far as strats/builds go it feels more flexible;8.7;1.0;0.0;144.0;31 March, 2022;307
136;For The Warp;30 I lean on the side of recommending this game however it seems like something about it makes me both love it and hate it I enjoy the game play and the styling of it makes it enjoyable But I feel like the art or game play just doesnt fit all together Its not terrible but it just seems like its lacking something Like a song without a chorus Feels like its got some good versus and its going somewhere but it just doesnt feel complete  Id definitely keep this game on deck if youre on the fence about getting it but if you feel like scratching an itch for some card battling then maybe this will be your scratch post;0.4;1.0;0.0;816.0;30 March, 2022;632
137;For The Warp;ry 5 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW kinda fun but way to meany bugs on my first run for some reason my ship did not take any damage from attack leading to an easy not fun win on my 2nd run game would 3 times when leaving events/combat the game got sort of soft locked were i had to quit to main menu and continue run to to keep playing not game breaking but very annoying;11.1;0.0;0.0;67.0;05 February, 2022;365

143;For The Warp;er 28 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Take one part FTL Faster Than Light and mix in a healthy helping of Slay the Spire then add just a tiny pinch of Halcyon 5s graphical style and you get this roguelike deckbuilder card combat game set in space While some of the strategies in the game appear to be more or less valid than others theres enough there to make the time spent worth it Overall the gameplay feels both familiar and fresh at the same time  Ive played it for 25 hours in one sitting and I am sure Ill come back to it more in the future;29.8;1.0;0.0;1158.0;28 November, 2021;555
144;For The Warp;er 27 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Early Access review mostly entertaining but seems to make no attempt at balance A balance pass will presumably come before the launch from Early Access post-Early Access update nope no apparent attempts at balance If the Heart of the Cards smiles on you you will draw amazing combos for free or not need combos at all due to single-card win conditions Or occasionally you will roll up to an enemy who will immediately attack for more damage than your hull+shields combined while you draw no defense  This game has promise and will probably get better but as of November 2021 it is not a game I can recommend;5.9;0.0;0.0;1453.0;27 November, 2021;652
145;For The Warp;er 22 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game has a lot of potential I dig the art style and I like the gameplay It can be seen that this is early access there are some graphical inconsistencies like loose anything that isnt pixelart from a pixelart game and balance issues and some cards doesnt work properly or not at all Or the description of some cards not accurate or just not contains enough info The deckbuilding part is strange to me and this is what I didnt really liked I can choose to have a card or not I can hardly get rid of cards that I dont need if Im unlucky I wont get the cards I need the most So it has a lot of randomness to it But what would Space RNJesus do D He would still recommend it and hope that in the future the finished game will have more balance and some more content and he would play through this game again;37.0;1.0;0.0;266.0;22 November, 2021;869
147;For The Warp;er 22 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A great start to a nice little deck-builder It has quite a few combos that work well and a few ships you can play as with different capabilities I do wish there were more to the game and I also wish the game loaded faster than it does;93.5;1.0;0.0;327.0;22 November, 2021;270
148;For The Warp;er 9 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Slay the Spire in SPAAAAAACE The exploration element is a nice way to grind and farm bad guys before you have to exit the level Cant wait to see what else they have in store for the game;77.8;1.0;0.0;144.0;09 November, 2021;221
149;For The Warp;ber 12 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Good game i feel the graphics vibe of into the breach game and the grid map remind me of Super Robot Wars SRW Series The dev offer a bit different rules of the card game without discarded game but always randomly spawn card from the deck but hey thats the challenge  Suggestion from me as the game is still alpha need more interactive and interesting event  I dont regret to bought this and still wait for the great development from the dev;10.9;1.0;0.0;127.0;12 September, 2021;495

155;For The Warp; 15 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW So far so good A good rougelike with lots of different styles of play The next big step would be hide the location of the next waygate giving a longer stint on the map;7.6;1.0;0.0;371.0;15 August, 2021;202
157;For The Warp; 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun and actually has an interesting design That being said its still unbalanced in alpha its incredibly easy to force a build without consequence due to the enemies lacking enough impact  I really enjoyed their deck design having no discard pool you draw and discard to the same pool Even though there are a lot of crazy loops you can pull off the number of cards you play is limited based on the number of cards in your original deck  This means you can place higher value on cards that dissipate during the fight as it allows your refined combo deck more cards to play  It would be interesting to see some balance around this aspect of the game via enemy auras and debuffs;10.4;1.0;0.0;276.0;14 May, 2021;712
158;For The Warp;10 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Not bad at all A few _very_ minor issues here and there sound volume bugs less than stellar clickmapping etc but hopefully they stick with the development and it continues to improve;20.7;1.0;0.0;617.0;10 April, 2021;218

173;For The Warp;y 27 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW While I much prefer Slay the Spire to this game it is still very good so far  Due to the fact there is no discard pile the game feels a lot more random until you get your deck sorted out You cant really predict what cards youre going to get unless you cycle through your entire deck which is possible based on what Ive seen;5.4;1.0;0.0;207.0;27 January, 2021;361
174;For The Warp;y 19 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Game is clearly in super early access but it is fun The design art and music are all good just need more of everything Keep up the good work team and this will be a solid keeper;11.2;1.0;0.0;112.0;19 January, 2021;214
175;For The Warp;y 19 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Cool game so far needs a lot more content but its in alpha Ive got 5 hours in and all ships except the hidden one are unlocked and Ive beat the game several times Already have all the cards memorized This could be really awesome but it really needs a lot more content to get there Already bored with it will check back when they update it;6.6;1.0;0.0;284.0;19 January, 2021;381
176;For The Warp;y 19 2021 Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I have decided that im am going to try and get myself more involved with card games like this one i received the product for free after hearing from a friend that he got it and rather liked it and very glad that i did First of all the art style i love it gotta say though i am a sucker for pixel art the music is very good as well and the game play is solid how it flows from map to battle sequence back to map Id have to give this maybe a 8/10 and its still in early access so it can only go up  Here is a video i made on it please note its a first impression video NOT a review;19.6;1.0;0.0;736.0;19 January, 2021;648
178;For The Warp;y 15 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Rogue-like deckbuilder in spaaaaaaaaaaaaace its amazing My only concern its that theres this weird feature that makes you play the game for 6 hours non-stop as soon as you install it Dont know if they should patch it but my eyes hurt;17.3;1.0;0.0;275.0;15 January, 2021;272
179;For The Warp;y 11 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Solid turn-based game If you liked FTL and you like games with deck based combat like gloom haven this is for you I like the music and the sound and not being followed by the big orange space fleet of FTL Explore kill loot buy;19.1;1.0;0.0;528.0;11 January, 2021;261
180;For The Warp;y 5 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW First time I sat down to play it five hours later Im having fun cant wait to see whats next;38.6;1.0;0.0;178.0;05 January, 2021;130
181;For The Warp;er 27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Played Alpha 90 version and am very interested in what they will continue to do with the game;28.5;1.0;0.0;7.0;27 December, 2020;128
182;For The Warp;er 17 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW good;36.0;1.0;0.0;39.0;17 December, 2020;36
183;For The Warp;er 5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I dont like rouge-like/lites am digging this game;4.6;1.0;0.0;728.0;05 December, 2020;83
184;For The Warp;er 4 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW fun game but needs more ships and cards would like a deck editor at the start of the game Keep up the great work really enjoying the game;15.7;1.0;0.0;80.0;04 November, 2020;170
185;For The Warp;y 11 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game is pretty well done on the deck building I also like how there is no discard pile mechanic to the game Game play itself is literally challenging depending on your card draws and deck build The game does a good job on making me think if i should add more cards to the deck or stay with a small deck I really wish the devs would have some type of controller support to the game though All in all the game is fluid and really solid Im looking forward to the future updates to this game;10.9;1.0;0.0;123.0;11 January, 2021;530
186;For The Warp;y 3 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW this game is super super promising but there are a couple of run-killing issues with it The main one being that there sometimes isnt an end to the game You can build a deck that makes all the enemies in the final zone completely trivial and then you cant actually LEAVE that zone because for whatever reason the warp gate is gone  Once they fix this and add a little more variety to the encounters and I do only mean a little it will be up there with legends of the genre like FTL;10.6;1.0;0.0;79.0;03 January, 2021;523
187;For The Warp;y 3 2021 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This has easily become one of my favorite games of all time If you like FTL and the card game Dominion then I highly recommend it Even in early access it is really good There are a few mistakes/bugs that Ive noticed but they dont affect the game play too much Sometimes the damage value calculations or other things seem to be off but it usually is in favor of the user Ive only played on normal mode so far but everything seems balanced and enjoyably random My only big critiques is that its too addicting to put down halfway through which can be a problem since it takes awhile to finish a game;188.5;1.0;0.0;78.0;03 January, 2021;639
188;For The Warp;er 29 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very promising early-access game and very playable in its current state If you liked FTL and Slay the Spire youll like this and if you didnt like one or either of them you probably wont I loved both games so Im excited to see how this develops;2.7;1.0;0.0;228.0;29 December, 2020;287
189;For The Warp;er 27 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Short but sweet little space deckbuilder I fail to see the rouglelike/lite aspect as different ships unlock when you defeat stage bosses but thats really not a concern  There is virtually no story here so those wanting an in-depth or even light story as you crush your enemies wont find one here This has more potential and I hope that the developer does seek out more recommendations before official launch  10/10 would answer the proximity detector alert again;4.7;1.0;0.0;81.0;27 December, 2020;507
190;For The Warp;ber 17 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Nice and simple and yet with its challenge and that one more turn feeling;12.0;1.0;1.0;768.0;17 September, 2020;109
191;For The Warp;ber 11 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like Slay the Spire I think youll like this game as well;23.8;1.0;1.0;79.0;11 September, 2020;97
192;For The Warp;ber 4 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very good Plays like any good spire type game but has a way of being still very unique and its own game 10/10 even for early access;12.6;1.0;1.0;820.0;04 September, 2020;167
193;For The Warp; 30 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW great game had a blast with it;64.4;1.0;1.0;132.0;30 August, 2020;60
194;For The Warp; 15 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very promising game waiting to see the release version;40.3;1.0;0.0;310.0;15 August, 2020;86
195;For The Warp; 23 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A nice game which lacks some polish at the moment You have too little control over the gameplay as the few possible combos depend on getting the required cards by luck The replay factor needs improvement too as you can only unlock 34 ship hulls but no powerfull cards or something similiar for the next round Currently there are only a few 5 levels/star systems which make the game very short Nevertheless I enjoyed it and hope for a DLC and the needed improvements;5.7;1.0;0.0;1287.0;23 August, 2020;508
196;For The Warp; 19 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A great start Ill admit its unbalanced at the moment but I really like the look and feel of the game Cant wait to see what else is in the pipeline;6.9;1.0;0.0;120.0;19 August, 2020;182
197;For The Warp; 15 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Pros Good core mechanics if unpolished and a bit clunky in execution atm Good play dynamic with the right additions I could see this being something I would heavily play and return to later not sure if it has the full potential of FTL/Slay the Spire but it could depending on further developments  Cons Feels like it has 1/3 to 1/2 of the cards necessary to make it reasonably dynamic Lacks the item variation and customization of Slay the Spire though if you could upgrade to slot more equipment and/or they added basic ship upgrades of some sort Only system variation seems to be enemies no FTL environmental dangers or crew flavor Deck randomization does functionally only reward a small deck  Try it out and hope for things to come;6.5;1.0;0.0;178.0;15 August, 2020;779
198;For The Warp; 14 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Solid game that scratched my itch for a space battle / deck-building / roguelike mashup This game reminds me a lot of FTL -- but I like what it is a lot better than FTL Gone is the hassle of micromanagement And the pixel art is good I look forward to the future of this game;15.6;1.0;0.0;322.0;14 August, 2020;309
199;For The Warp; 13 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Worth a short play Overall I would say this game has a lot of potential and the style is there It needs a good bit of cleaning and a lot of encounter/non-combat content I hope this sale gets it the attention it needs I look forward to playing this some time down the road;7.0;1.0;0.0;294.0;13 August, 2020;306
200;For The Warp; 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very fun turn based Rogue LOVE IT I RECOMMEND TRYING IT;13.0;1.0;0.0;124.0;01 July, 2020;83
201;For The Warp; 1 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like card-based strategy games all things considered this ones pretty cool Easy to learn difficult to master Luck is still an important factor but then again what card-based game DOESNT need a little luck;19.9;1.0;0.0;81.0;01 August, 2020;249
202;For The Warp;9 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A genuine gem of a game that contends with its likenesses of FTL and Slay the Spire It needs optimization and for the love of god drones need to fire before the enemys turn but I genuinely havent had this much fun in ages Great title;17.4;1.0;0.0;239.0;29 July, 2020;268
203;For The Warp;6 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A bit buggy and perhaps a little unbalanced at the time you can win if you spend a bunch of time doing fights rather than rushing the exit but pretty fun overall;52.2;1.0;0.0;71.0;16 July, 2020;193
204;For The Warp;1 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW My first experience with a roguelike deckbuilder I only decided to purchase it because of the great pixel art and space theme as well as the fact that I needed a new passtime After 2 hours in I can honestly say that this will definitely be game I can play when I need a break I cant wait until the full game comes out;186.0;1.0;0.0;61.0;11 June, 2020;352
205;For The Warp; 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is a fun little deck-building space combat game that scratches a lot of itches for me theres a nice variety of cards that you randomly get that challenges you to change your strategies the music is excellent and the Lost in Deep Space vibe captures some of that FTL vibes an obvious stylistic inspiration  Really enjoyable cant wait for the full game;15.4;1.0;0.0;646.0;09 May, 2020;391
206;For The Warp;29 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW this game is fun as long as it is in alpha that means more content as long as devs dont mess it up this one will just keep growing also im a big fan of crying suns  EDIT been a couple months no news hoping its not dead has some bugs its looking like abandonware still fun but looks to join the ranks of games forgotten;46.3;1.0;0.0;272.0;29 April, 2020;365
207;For The Warp;5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Often absolutely dependent on luck in the first turn without any reshuffle options especially encounters with multiple units not having shield cards usually means game over Most of the battles are about getting enough shield points and stopping the occasional powerful attacks;14.3;1.0;0.0;212.0;05 April, 2020;308
208;For The Warp;5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun for a few hours Seems poorly balanced I beat the game on my second try by using an infinite healing infinite money infinite stun all enemies loop;6.1;1.0;0.0;653.0;05 April, 2020;182
209;For The Warp;5 2020 EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I really think theres something here that could become a lot more than a simple deck builder with how the art style and soundtrack gripped me instantly Looking forward to see where this goes theres a lot of potential if the gameplay gets some real depth Some ftl-style random encounters would do wonders for this game as well;36.3;1.0;0.0;94.0;05 April, 2020;359
210;ELDEN RING; I started the journey as a lowly tarnished with only the guidance of grace to guide me on a perilous path of struggle hardship and suffering I stumbled I failed and I died I came back up again learning from my mistakes In the journey I faced many great enemies Some I admired and respected while some I loathed and hated yet thankful for them all I made friends learned from teachers faced-off adversaries fell in love cried in loss and shared on the happiness of each and every characters of the game For those who may call me their consort their lambkin their tarnished or even their lord i express my thanks  This game was my second entry to fromsoftwares  the first being sekiro and I am at a loss of words to express the emotional rollercoaster I went through during my playthroughs I now understand why their games are so well-celebrated and has such a vast community  It doesnt matter if I am a lowly tanished I shall never put my foolish ambitions to rest;282.6;1.0;20.0;222.0;10 May, 2022;995

218;ELDEN RING; At a 150 hours I said Nope wont do it no more after getting stuck on another golden horse boi before Maliketh And 3 days later I realized I got so far and that Im slightly addicted to this game and I have to complete it This game is a little bit like the relationship with your ex-boyfriend The sex is so  good but he treats you like trash 10/10 Would bang again;179.7;1.0;4.0;363.0;10 May, 2022;385

226;ELDEN RING;Liked everything  Game has space for someone to stop and level up if they arent strong enough for a challenge Different builds feel completely different Each weapon feels very unique The tone and art of the game is amazing  For me this is the best game in the past 15 years;179.0;1.0;4.0;116.0;08 May, 2022;280
229;ELDEN RING; Had a ball with Elden Ring I played a lot of Dark Souls 1 and I can say that Im really happy with how the game came out theres still things that feel unfair or encounters specifically designed to annoy rather than challenge but I still think it was a great experience;70.8;1.0;3.0;413.0;13 May, 2022;278

237;ELDEN RING;Ive really been enjoying this game and its so  good but why is this game pulled down by this God awful pc port the fact there is a 60FPS limit on a PC game in 2022 is ridiculous I highly recommend playing this game but just on principle Im giving this game a negative review because this pc port is unforgivable in my eyes do better on pc ports from software there is no reason it should have these issues and limitations  But if you dont care about pc performance u should definitely buy this game its fire;59.6;0.0;8.0;62.0;09 May, 2022;524
238;ELDEN RING;After years of waiting Elden Ring does not disappoint representing the cumulation of all the things FromSoft has learned over the recent decades taking and refining previous ideas to perfection Elden Ring possesses an unparalleled level of exploration gorgeous terrain well hidden secrets and incredible boss fights making it one of the most compelling open worlds ever Aside from some reused content and poor balancing of certain aspects of the PvP and PvE this game remains a masterpiece of both RPGs and open world games alike;355.3;1.0;4.0;165.0;09 May, 2022;537

274;ELDEN RING;First of all I suppose its not a masterpiece game like others saying just because of the open world and some in game mechanics reuse Second Im not a huge fan of soulsbut I have Bloodborne platinum Babadzaki made me suffer until I found a jumping farm option But Guys Im observing the AAA game segment and its not that clear Nowadays a number a  games are coming and what to conceal we will gain more in future In this case we have here no more just a game but the only industry hope Cyberpunk died in the childhood Ubisoft making mobile games EA making football casino so who can save gamers I can say only one thing we need to buy games like Elden Ring To show investors we are interested in such mediaproduct We dont give a hell about mobile gaming we need epic tough singleplayer games  Slap like if you agree;201.3;1.0;2.0;459.0;09 May, 2022;854

302;ELDEN RING; Truly a game ahead of its time one of the best dating sims Ive played to date There isnt a lot of love interests to choose from but there is this whole boss fighting system attached to it;95.8;1.0;1.0;25.0;14 May, 2022;194
303;ELDEN RING; MASTERPIECE;57.1;1.0;1.0;100.0;14 May, 2022;12
304;ELDEN RING; Never played dark souls but this is one of the best games ever made;117.8;1.0;1.0;307.0;14 May, 2022;68
305;ELDEN RING; This game is awesome There is just so much to explore and so much to do This is my first Dark Souls game and I really like it;143.9;1.0;1.0;38.0;14 May, 2022;129
306;ELDEN RING; Sekiro was better The late game areas are pain Some things are only exist to cause you pain with no reward This game is a DS 22 with nice grapichs with a huge open world This game is a 5/10 for me ofc Many times the game was a 10/10 for me as well but the late game areas and some bosses and some areas are just pure pain Some bosses are pure fun and have a great learning curve but other times you regret your life decisions;103.5;0.0;3.0;153.0;10 May, 2022;437
308;ELDEN RING; As someone who has been looking forward to this game for a really long time i can say that it easily exceeded the hype around it which nowadays is rarethe difficulty of this game varies by how you go about but ultimately how you play determines the difficulty which is very different from previous souls games which are linear and unless you beat a certain boss you cannot progress;111.0;1.0;1.0;37.0;14 May, 2022;384
309;ELDEN RING; An incredible game overall with some of the best examples of why the Dark Souls games are so beloved by many So many builds so little time with some balance patching needed regarding endgame imo this truly has the potential to be From Softwares best effort yet Whether a returning Souls vet like myself or a newcomer whos never touched an action RPG youll fall in-love with this world and the famous immersion and wonder that come with it Cant recommend it enough;488.8;1.0;1.0;150.0;14 May, 2022;477

318;ELDEN RING; This game sucks Its trash its ass I dont know what this is supposed to be but it is slow and unresponsive it feels unfinished and empty Save your money and hope that Fable 4 can deliver what this game couldnt Pushing a boulder up a hill is not fun The only way to become the elden lord is to break the cycle and stop playing this ass crack garbage;58.4;0.0;1.0;16.0;14 May, 2022;354
319;ELDEN RING; This game is worth the 60$ imo Its a very open world layout with not much in the way of real barriers to block you off from zone to zone and when there is a barrier there is also a way around it The fighting style is basically Dark Souls 3 which is a bonus The game is hard if you try and just play it like a souls game and roll through it all however if you take your time to explore and scavenge this game becomes so easy;377.2;1.0;1.0;225.0;14 May, 2022;432

328;ELDEN RING; Probably hands down the absolute best souls game I have ever played  And Ive played them all to all Achievements and NG+7  Can confirm this is the best one Id suggest not interacting with the community much since everyone thinks they know the best things for everything  play how you want - Enjoy your time in the Lands Between  Only one Complain Which will likely be fixed  Connection Issues  Nothing worse that being in a boss fight in a co-op playthrough with a brother and it says ____ Has return to their world Had this happen on different internet connections along with being on the same one;117.5;1.0;1.0;789.0;13 May, 2022;613

365;ELDEN RING; This game is  because im not good at it;87.3;1.0;1.0;4.0;11 May, 2022;45
366;ELDEN RING; Skyrim/WoW on steroids with buckets of atmosphere I love this game Its definitely more ideal to controller users but you can make a working keyboard/mouse bind easy enough to the point it feels like a PC game and not a console port Im pretty much used to playing this with keyboard and mouse now took a few hours to get used to it but its fine My only advice is to just explore everything for yourself avoid anything on Youtube so the game doesnt get ruined Definitely the best game Ive played in a long while;42.7;1.0;1.0;231.0;12 May, 2022;525
369;ELDEN RING; This game was a first to me in the souls genre and i have to say its amazingly hard for a brand new player The controls are not hard to understand but the timings and little things are the trickiest Overall its a fun experience and ive barely made progress in the game so theres a lot more stuff to discover and hate myself for;21.8;1.0;0.0;8.0;11 May, 2022;336
370;ELDEN RING; Made me get up shower and look for maidens IRL but only after 150 hours  10/10 would recommend;168.8;1.0;1.0;287.0;11 May, 2022;101
371;ELDEN RING; First souls game ever for me and couldnt be better;62.3;1.0;1.0;68.0;11 May, 2022;52
372;ELDEN RING; This game is like wearing one of the most comfortable shoes in the world but the shoe has a pebble stuck in it that you cant get out  This is an incredible game full of originality heaps of content and replayability tons of player agency and a really fun gameplay loop However it is plagued by nonsensical design decisions and bugs that impact my experience of the game every single time I play it  Bugs like the cursor not staying locked to the game window causing me to click on stuff on my second monitor and tabbing me out of the game and server issues causing frequent disconnects during coop and design decisions like the incredibly long wait to quit out of the game and popups always automatically hovering on no instead of yes forcing me to move my mouse cursor sometimes mid-combat to select yes severely impact my enjoyment of the game Bringing the game from one of my favourites to something I always find myself getting frustrated at while playing;145.9;1.0;1.0;219.0;11 May, 2022;982
373;ELDEN RING; turtle pope;99.9;1.0;1.0;297.0;11 May, 2022;12
374;ELDEN RING; Excellent game Combines best part of Souls with open world I cant even touch things like Skryim after this GOTY;157.6;1.0;1.0;131.0;11 May, 2022;116
375;ELDEN RING; Easily one of my favorite games of all time;304.7;1.0;1.0;83.0;11 May, 2022;45

378;ELDEN RING; This game might be hard when you start playing it but it gets better as you learn how to play it By far my favourite rpg game Worth every penny would recommend;64.0;1.0;1.0;26.0;11 May, 2022;161
379;ELDEN RING; I got my ass beat learned lessons through metaphors about not giving up learned to also give up when invaded by naked people with clubs felt empty inside after beating the game because it was always about the journey not the destination and now the journey was over ahh its fine Ill just do it all again on a new character right  Games are rarely designed so well these days Elden Ring is by no means perfect but the overall experience of playing this is second to none It also offers a lot to folks who enjoy their lore in games Cant wait for the inevitable DLC;190.0;1.0;1.0;206.0;11 May, 2022;582
380;ELDEN RING; My first souls game really good;170.1;1.0;1.0;570.0;11 May, 2022;34

386;ELDEN RING; SUPERRRR;139.2;1.0;1.0;21.0;11 May, 2022;9
387;ELDEN RING; Elden Ring so far is my Game of the year I thought I was not going to beat it just for the fact that I am not one who thrives on challenging bosses and certain hoards of enemies Luckily friends help ease the pain When I did beat the bosses it felt super rewarding and satisfying The graphics are great the battle mechanics are pretty solid and I think the open world helps because you can do stuff in any order if you please I also lost my runes quite often mostly falling off cliffs and going through catacombs to retrieve my runes and failing in the processes Once I beat a boss I leveled up immediately I will say that FromSoftware did a fantastic job I definitely recommend Elden Ring to everyone The only warning I have is you may experience emotional breakdowns because of how many times you will die;118.2;1.0;1.0;28.0;10 May, 2022;822
388;ELDEN RING; A lot of trail and error Really fun tho;197.8;1.0;1.0;57.0;10 May, 2022;42
389;ELDEN RING; It is a very good and for the most part fun but it has some major flaws bosses will have very quick attacks that are hard to detect some bosses have attacks that you cant do much about there are many bugs and glitches still in the game and bleed/magic builds are the meta with other builds being to weak or slow to be able to kill bosses efficiently But other than I do really enjoy dedicating my time to the game and plan to play more;112.1;1.0;1.0;14.0;10 May, 2022;443
390;ELDEN RING; very fun game level of difficulty is beyond any other game ive played;6.7;1.0;1.0;42.0;10 May, 2022;71
391;ELDEN RING; i happened to compare the size of the map to my friends as being SEVERAL GTA V maps combined so much to explore learn and change through the game i still havent beaten it and i currently have over 200 hours in the game;220.7;1.0;1.0;76.0;10 May, 2022;219
392;ELDEN RING; after playing for 13 hours i can say this is one of the best games ive ever played and would recommend it to anyone who is planning to buy it;58.7;1.0;1.0;7.0;10 May, 2022;144
393;ELDEN RING; WARING PLAYING THIS GAME MAY BRING YOU MORE FUN THAN YOU CAN HANDLE WHILE ALSO MAKING YOU WANT TO BASH YOUR HEAD INTO A WALL its a great game it can me rly hard sometimes but i also suck at this game so that might be why;9.4;1.0;1.0;8.0;10 May, 2022;224
394;ELDEN RING; Not sure why the monkeys working at fromsoftware thought it was a good idea to let players learn the boss mechanics and dodge it makes the game piss easy;85.4;1.0;1.0;164.0;10 May, 2022;154
395;ELDEN RING; Elden Ring made me happy like Ocarina of Time did back in 1998;316.9;1.0;1.0;389.0;10 May, 2022;63
396;ELDEN RING; One of the best games Ive ever played Cant recommend enough;140.3;1.0;1.0;108.0;10 May, 2022;64
397;ELDEN RING; I thought I wouldnt love it as much as the other games but I was wrong This game is amazing and does a lot of things right from the previous titles My only issue is that there is a jarring comparison to dark souls 2 and the pvp is crowded with afks and high leveled phantom ganking I love co oping and they did a fantastic job of making this game enjoyable for every type of player Keep at it From Soft;410.8;1.0;1.0;279.0;10 May, 2022;411
399;ELDEN RING; One of the most well-crafted and beautiful open worlds Ive ever immersed myself into Despite completing the entire game I still feel an urge to explore and somehow always keep finding new things  10/10 game without a doubt;71.7;1.0;1.0;94.0;10 May, 2022;228

418;ELDEN RING;After 50h + I can clearly say this is one of the best games I ever played Incredibly hard it will show u painfully every single mistake U make but its also incredibly satisfying Amazing scenery and atmosphere the game have something that keeps U coming back over and over again to try one more time to beat that boss Words cannot describe it if U ever played Souls games its a must but if U never played Souls games before U gotta try it ;57.7;1.0;1.0;683.0;09 May, 2022;450
419;ELDEN RING;After making a second character because I was unhappy with the build on the first one I beat this game in 30 hours Even though it didnt take me long I loved almost every hour There are some issues with performance and balance both with weapons and enemies but they are far outweighed by the good of this game  To beat this game in 30 hours means I missed probably 75% of all of the world - it is huge and beautiful Now on my third character I am exploring more and having just as much if not more fun than I did with my last character To someone who doesnt know what Souls games are they might not like this game It is difficult and unforgiving just like the previous games If you like the previous games this one takes all the strong elements of those and puts it in something so expansive that you might find something new in a playthrough years from now;78.5;1.0;1.0;128.0;09 May, 2022;873

426;Titanfall® 2; Great campaign but its short and right now the multiplayer is completely broken and wont open for me and many others all support for this game has been shut down by the developers and hacking raids have made the multiplayer unplayable for most people DO NOT PURCHASE THIS it is not worth the money in its current state I have played this game across multiple platforms and it is borderline unplayable on all of them i repeat DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IN ITS CURRENT STATE hopefully it will be fixed but that is very unlikely unfortunately;6.1;0.0;34.0;26.0;12 May, 2022;541
429;Titanfall® 2; Loved this game at its peak but now its a shell the servers are dead 90% if not 100% of the time not dead as in no player base but dead as in unplayable yeah you can play the amazing single player campaign but after that theres nothing since the majority of the game play in in Titanfall 1 took place online youd expect to play a lot of Titanfall 2 online as well but thanks to either the devs giving up and focusing Apex or hackers a lot of speculation for who killed the game I dont recommend this game anymore its not even worth the $4 USD they are asking for it at this point they are snatching at any money they can make but dont have hope for a third one with their shift towards battle royal I will miss BT and I will miss my minigun titan hot dropping and wiping the other team out;35.8;0.0;6.0;126.0;13 May, 2022;815
430;Titanfall® 2; I am not a FPS fan I dont play FPS games but when I do it has been Valorant recently I would say Titanfall but ever since the DDos of the servers the game is unplayable It is very disheartening to see one of my favorite childhood games and franchises loose to a outside source I love this game the series to death If you are looking to purchase to play multiplayer good luck The server will randomly crash but on other days they work Its very shaky right now and sadly I think that is the best this game can do to recover I dont have many hours on my steam profile But I was easily gen 15 on my Xbox and played this game religiously when it came out Thats about 300-500 hours for those who dont know I love this game to death and I hope to see a sequel Keep it up Apex is a great game as well;29.0;1.0;2.0;146.0;13 May, 2022;809
432;Titanfall® 2; Very immersive and addictive story mode although a little short which left me feeling like I needed more in the end But this also makes the game easily replayable;18.1;1.0;1.0;61.0;13 May, 2022;167

439;Titanfall® 2; I like many others love this game to its core and would play it daily if the community was still alive and not full of hackers Im sure but woe is me for my first desktop has a wifi 6 enabled motherboard with an 11th generation Intel processor which means I cannot connect to the multiplayer servers due to a difference in security technology I still recommend this game if you have a 10th gen or earlier processor but as for myself I weep;0.7;1.0;1.0;158.0;13 May, 2022;449

448;Titanfall® 2;The single player campaign is gorgeous but only 7 hours long on my first run Clearly intended to be driven by multi-player like plenty of games since which is a bit disappointing Still it was fun and I typically hate jumping puzzle games If youre looking for a pretty quick little Halo + Portal kind of vibe not a bad way to spend a weekend;7.9;1.0;1.0;203.0;08 May, 2022;353
449;Titanfall® 2;I have hundreds of hours on this game on console This game has set the standard for how fun an FPS game can be in both campaign and multiplayer Every FPS I play will be compared to Titanfall 2 The abysmal marketing and release window given to this game by higher-up executives at EA is a tragedy on par with the death of JFK and Im 100% serious;2.8;1.0;1.0;92.0;08 May, 2022;350

465;Titanfall® 2; Honestly great game with wonderful visuals for a 2014 shooter and a mediocre story However the gameplay is where its at I played this after Apex expecting an Apex campaign-like game but holy cow the movement the guns everything is just right I said before the story is mediocre but the setting is not Apex had a great starting ground for a story because Titanfall 2 created the world  Sadly the game came riddled with bugs and glitches and crashed constantly I played the campaign first which took around 5 hours hard mode and it was amazing I tried the multiplayer and was surprised when it could literally never work I took a break and tried to come back and play the campaign again but the game would freeze-frame and never work  Great Gameplay good campaign captivating world but sadly riddled with technical errors not allowing constant playing;7.0;1.0;1.0;25.0;10 May, 2022;876

519;Titanfall® 2; One of the EA games that are actually good graphics are amazing movement is smooth and the story is pretty cool as well Ive played Apex Legends and although that is a great game I think Titanfall 2 is a lot better worth the price I got this on sale for 3184HKD but I would definitely still buy it at full price 199HKD If only EA put as much resources and work as this game into Madden NFL 22;5.4;1.0;0.0;23.0;14 May, 2022;408

528;Titanfall® 2; Used to play this almost everyday back on PS4 now that I got it on PC im a bit disappointed The Campaign somehow feels shorter than I remember Maybe because I used to suck at the campaign I breezed through the game on hard mode and the multiplayer is quite literally unplayable I used to just play Frontier Defense all the time on my PS4 but it seems that I cannot do the same on my PC the Frontier Defense has terrible cue times even worse than League of Legends on mobile Its still a fun game but I wouldnt recommend buying it full price do what I did and wait for a sale and buy it when the sale drops;5.7;1.0;0.0;31.0;13 May, 2022;620
529;Titanfall® 2; W campaign still good ever since it was first released Multiplayer is amazing although u might have some problems using multiplayer at first u can always just search up some easy fixes to use this feature 10/10 game play it when u can;23.5;1.0;0.0;7.0;13 May, 2022;241

539;Titanfall® 2; This game is the absolute best fast paced action shooter that youve always wanted Move over Call of Duty and Battlefield this is by far a better game Like being able to operate heavy vehicles like in Battlefield Well just wait till you suit up in a Titan Love the intense action of Call of Duty The mobility and gunplay of Titanfall has it beat The movement system in Titanfall 2 is and Im not exaggerating here the absolute best in any game ever I would say that Warframe is a close second The single player is amazing as well There is a part of the game trying not to spoil much here where you gain a mechanic similar to Portal that is so so so so far ahead of its time  Its a shame that it doesnt have the support that it should from the parent company but with the Northstar client you will be able to enjoy endless hours of gameplay  Highly Highly recommend;186.5;1.0;0.0;58.0;12 May, 2022;890

568;Titanfall® 2;This game was a breath of fresh air for me A somewhat modern game that is honestly an easy 10/10 for me which is so so so rare I enjoyed every second of the campaign literally It was so well done The multiplayer is decent and gives more longevity but I HIGHLY recommended this game for the campaign You will feel so connected to your pilot and it really just is amazing I havent come across ANY glitches while going for 100% in the game and just Wow Good job Respawn team I cant wait for Titanfall 3;17.4;1.0;0.0;220.0;09 May, 2022;512
569;Titanfall® 2;I heard people saying this game was good so when it went on sale for like $3 I picked up and just played the campaign The campaign isnt long about 6 hours but its really well made Unlike the average FPS this game has parkour mechanics and you get to pilot the robot named BT The parkour sections are really fluid and well made I had a lot of fun with them One part I really like is that while the tutorial teaches you how to play it also tests your skill level and then it recommended that I play on hard difficulty If you know how to play an FPS game hard is a good difficulty for you The story is a lot more interesting than I thought for such a short game The 2 main characters Cooper and BT have entertaining dialogue with each other and it keeps the game fun Even though hes a robot BT feels like a real unique character not just the boring robot stereotype If you see the game is on sale for $5 or less its worth it just to experience the campaign Score 6/7;6.5;1.0;0.0;22.0;09 May, 2022;991

579;Titanfall® 2;The story is nice the movement is amazing guns feel awesome but sadly the game died because of DDOSers A good game if you play for the story unplayable in multiplayer Id only recommend buying this if it becomes free to play  Apart from the multiplayer issue its a good game 8/10;14.3;1.0;0.0;18.0;08 May, 2022;287

584;Titanfall® 2;Just the campaign alone is worth the 30$ I think Multiplayer is also good but I wish Respawn actually cared about this game and fix the damn servers;19.8;1.0;0.0;5.0;08 May, 2022;152

598;Titanfall® 2;This is if not the best at least one of the best campaigns Ive ever played Never fails to make me cry Amazing movement and shooting feel Outstanding voice acting and mocap Oh and the intro Talk about setting up expectations for a game and establishing a lore about what a Pilot is I love you BT-7274 and I always will;6.9;1.0;0.0;351.0;07 May, 2022;322
599;Titanfall® 2;By far the best movement based first person shooter ever made Even years later I still find my self booting it up anytime I wan some fast paced action Only Wish Respawn would manage the servers better Or at all But on the rare occurrence that the games servers arent hacked its a must play;164.3;1.0;0.0;19.0;07 May, 2022;296

660;Red Dead Redemption 2;this is the best game ever made i think every single person with an interest in video games should play this the first like 3 hours or so is a slow on-rails story/dialogue heavy prologue but once youre free to roam the open world this is a transcendent experience cons this is the best looking game ever made so you will need a good pc to run it i played it at mid graphic settings on a 6core i5 and a 970 at like 30 fps and still had a  blast and was constantly blown away by this game  Edit forgot to mention i have not touched the online mode at all i hear its pretty much forgotten and bug/hacker ridden the fact i have at time of review over 400 hours and still have only played single player tells you pretty much everything you need to know about this game;414.2;1.0;2.0;91.0;08 May, 2022;785

671;Red Dead Redemption 2; Very good game The missions seem so fluid and just like real life It isnt like starting a contract from scratch The sound design is truly perfect It greatly helps to feel really immersed While I was reading the newspaper in the street people were walking by sound of blacksmth people talking etc And the voice acting is super too The initial camp also felt a lot like the Hateful Eights vibes with Arthur in the blue coat just like Samuel L Jackson in the movie Really I am loving this game so far and from what I have been told and the story which is gonna get better chapter by chapter I think this game is gonna be at the same level of the Witcher games for me;15.7;1.0;2.0;54.0;11 May, 2022;683

679;Red Dead Redemption 2;Online Cash Grab Rockstar does not update this amazing game anymore what a shame Plus out sourced the online portion to take 2 which is a complete and obvious cash grab company Single player is amazing though but they never updated it and never used the content they put into the game I would recommend if they actually gave a crap about their game They should make two takes before they give take 2 the online portion Singleplayer is still good enough to be recommended alone;10.1;1.0;0.0;58.0;08 May, 2022;483
680;Red Dead Redemption 2;Yeah story is pretty good Havent touch much of online Maybe like 4 hours total Rest is story Modding is slowly coming out but be careful with timing/ interactions Some of the games mechanics havent fully been figured out yet You shouldnt be paying for a game at full price x amount of years after launch Wait for a sale they have them all the time  World is easy to get lost in Its living breathing and full of life Was wonderful to play hike hunt fish etc during the early days of covid;893.4;1.0;1.0;378.0;08 May, 2022;509
681;Red Dead Redemption 2;Im in love with this game Its epic The views are beautiful and everything has so much detail Only 23% into the story mode but so far its been really interesting for sure my new favourite game However online mode isnt always great due to cheaters;171.8;1.0;1.0;5.0;08 May, 2022;256
682;Red Dead Redemption 2; Hello from an avid Red Dead Redemption fan This game is absolutely stunning for anyone wanting an amazing single-player experience this is the game As fun as online is it gets stale fast I am level 110 and its still fun if you know where to look But as many have already heard Rockstar neglects this masterpiece to appeal to their shareholders keeping GTA V alive If they gave even 20% of their current attention on GTA V to RDRO then this game would be absolutely perfect It feels sometimes that the game developers at Rockstar are just being held hostage GTA V needs to die and move on to bigger and better things That being said I would recommend RDR and RDRO for the ultimate western experience Unfortunately only for a short time Thanks Jake;263.7;1.0;1.0;101.0;11 May, 2022;764

691;Red Dead Redemption 2; I have not played any other games in this story line previously but still thoroughly enjoy this one Husband and I got this mainly to play Online together but quickly switched to the single player story mode instead 100 hours in and still not done with the story side missions or challenges the game has to offer What primarily draws me into continue playing is the story line and the fact that I can suck at the game and still get through the story ;100.4;1.0;1.0;273.0;13 May, 2022;458

720;Red Dead Redemption 2; requires a rockstar online social club membership to play single player offline  there appears to be no way around this membership you cant just tell steam to play offline and play the game you legally bought  also the social club authorisation you MUST have to play the game simply does not work even if you are logged into your rockstar account and have linked steam to it it just rejects your game as an unauthorised log in no matter what  It has never worked once for me despite dozens of attempts to get them to recognise the game I paid AAA prices for  steam refuses refund as allegedly not working is not a breach of consumer law  dont touch this walk away now;0.6;0.0;2.0;398.0;14 May, 2022;682

760;Red Dead Redemption 2; Buy it for the Story mode but  Red Dead Online is made to just make you spend more money on an already expensive game  Forces you to use Rockstar Launcher and even the offline Story Mode requires that you are online while playing Meanwhile the game has already been cracked and the crack works offline So the people who pay for the game get a worse experience than the people who dont have to   Edit Apparently you CAN play the Story Mode offline without internet But still my point still stands the people with the cracked version do not have to put up with the Rockstar launcher And others have reported problems with playing Story Mode when Rockstar Servers were down;4.3;0.0;0.0;144.0;14 May, 2022;689

790;Red Dead Redemption 2;I had this game on my wishlist since it launched and finally bought it when it went on sale I was hoping it would be like Skyrim with an old-west setting and weapons Like Skyrim it starts off with a long cut-scene but where Skyrim basically sets you free afterward RDR2 keeps you locked into a story for who knows how long I quit after an hour and got a refund  - I found the UI very awkward for use on a PC It is clearly designed for a console - Very difficult to target and interact with objects - Motion on foot or on horseback is slow to respond and gets really messed up if you try to engage in dialogue while moving as is expected during the initial ride in the blizzard - Switching between 1st and 3rd person view is awkward Mouse-wheel zooming to do this is somewhat of an industry standard - but not in this game  I imagine most if the great reviews are coming from console players who are used to this kind of UI I play exclusively on a PC and expect better;0.9;0.0;1.0;51.0;07 May, 2022;989

820;Red Dead Redemption 2; Game was good while I could play it but now the Rockstar Launcher has bugged out and wont let the game launch I only play single player  Only buy it if youre willing to risk suddenly not having access to the game anymore thanks to a poorly integrated unnecessary launcher;27.9;0.0;0.0;223.0;14 May, 2022;281
821;Red Dead Redemption 2; Unacceptably awful port I literally cannot change graphics settings without crashing the game Awful DRM & dependency on Rockstar Games Launcher now I cannot even start the game without getting some Error response received from Steam My opinion may change if I figure out how to actually play the game;1.4;0.0;0.0;71.0;14 May, 2022;305

823;Subnautica: Below Zero; Loved the original but this game is pretty weak Way smaller and shallower map everything is brightly lit the predators are a joke and the atmosphere and horror is tuned down to 0;50.4;0.0;11.0;99.0;13 May, 2022;184
824;Subnautica: Below Zero; More Subnautica more to love;43.7;1.0;10.0;809.0;12 May, 2022;31
825;Subnautica: Below Zero; Just play the original again instead This one simply doesnt vibe The quality-of-life improvements are nice but its just not as good as the first especially the music and athmosphere is lacking;15.5;0.0;5.0;129.0;14 May, 2022;199
826;Subnautica: Below Zero; This game was originally intended to be a DLC addition to the original and it SHOWS Significantly shorter smaller map less interesting progression and a weaker story  I CANNOT recommend buying this game at full price its just too much for what youre getting On a 50% off sale go for it but this isnt worth the full price;75.7;1.0;26.0;129.0;13 May, 2022;334
827;Subnautica: Below Zero; I liked the first Subnauticas storyline better I felt it was too short But I enjoyed the new items and creatures in this one If they brought out a 3rd game that was equally as long and interesting story line as the first one plus the new items Id really enjoy that  Still a good game;36.7;1.0;13.0;148.0;12 May, 2022;291
828;Subnautica: Below Zero; Probably a good game if you havent played the first but compared to the first its a massive disappointment It feels like a DLC rather than a sequel and even as a DLC it wouldve been meh at best They managed to sort out the pop-in issues for the most part but other than that they stripped out everything I loved and was looking forward to more of from the first game  Im hoping for a sequel and want more from these devs but it has to be a thumbs down as I really hope they go back to the cyclops and the focus on the dark scary depths of the first No more above land stuff please;21.2;0.0;21.0;115.0;13 May, 2022;601
831;Subnautica: Below Zero; Firstly this game is GOOD But it is a very short game against the first game Subnautica I finished the game in 13 hours of gameplay without tutorials But in the other game Subnautica I played it 30 hours but I still could not finish it So the other game is cool but if you wanna have fun you can buy it;13.9;1.0;7.0;39.0;12 May, 2022;312
833;Subnautica: Below Zero; An amazing continuation of the first game As always the biomes are absolutely magical and jaw-dropping SPOILERS BELOW -The tracker tool is an amazing addition really helpful -The customizable sea truck is a game changer way less bulky and cumbersome to maneuver than the cyclops albeit less spacious -The addition of the temperature makes land exploration more challenging which I personally enjoyed -A lot more story based than the first but still a lot to explore freely  There are some downsides -The snowfox is a bit of a headache to drive not sure if its meant to be so sensitive -The tether tool seems kinda pointless only one direction and it only works with the original teleporter module so you cant have multiple teleporter locations If you teleport away from your prawn suit or sea truck theres no easy getting back to them;37.0;1.0;1.0;16.0;14 May, 2022;852
834;Subnautica: Below Zero; Good game but worse than its prequel Subnautica Worth trying if you loved Subnautica;75.9;1.0;3.0;20.0;12 May, 2022;87
835;Subnautica: Below Zero; If you like the first one then Below Zero will disapoint you The deep dive exploring and all the other fun and unique mechanics are gone  Blow Zero;23.4;0.0;6.0;345.0;13 May, 2022;155
836;Subnautica: Below Zero;Terrible game because you lose the immersion from the first game by giving the character a voice and dialogue;26.4;0.0;3.0;14.0;08 May, 2022;109
837;Subnautica: Below Zero;Honestly I think this is just as good as the first game The atmosphere is beautiful I love how there is more land to explore and the story is great too;87.1;1.0;2.0;43.0;09 May, 2022;156
838;Subnautica: Below Zero; Its really good PROS big upgrade in terms of cool looking environment story is kinda interesting nothing special still cool looking creatures which are arguably better than the first CONS more exploration not as scary  the alone feeling is missing and its less open and dark but more beautifull overall i would buy this if you liked exploration in the original or just want more subnautica Dont buy when your just looking for a scare;28.7;1.0;1.0;42.0;13 May, 2022;444
839;Subnautica: Below Zero; I really enjoyed the story of survival mode it definitely payed its respects to the first game with the technology and the connections with the first game and the creative aspect is also wonderful the freedom to build whatever you want really does bring another level to this game with the new assets and such  10/10 highly reccomend this if you enjoy survival/building games;6.8;1.0;1.0;6.0;12 May, 2022;383
840;Subnautica: Below Zero; I have to rate this game negatively in hopes the devs make another because I would like to see changes  Basically Subnautica was/is a complete masterpiece Absolutely terrifying and wonderful At the end I just wanted more bigger levels more leviathans more cyclops  Below Zero does not provide this and the game is weaker for it I wish the devs had spent less time world building and more time building environment size leviathan size and sea truck size Hopefully there is another game and it goes back to the feeling of the original game;44.0;0.0;3.0;110.0;14 May, 2022;550

889;Subnautica: Below Zero; Awesome game;9.7;1.0;0.0;17.0;14 May, 2022;13
890;Subnautica: Below Zero; Generally feels a bit less coherent than the original It spreads itself thin theres a larger focus on terrestrial exploration which pulls you away from the main gameplay loop of going deeper and deeper It feels like a jarring cutaway from the thing you play the game for  Additionally the linear story draws away from one of my favorite parts of the first game No longer are you exploring out of an intrinsic curiosity but rather a linear series of events is pushing you forward constantly The first game had things to push you forward but there were several points at which you were left to your own devices It takes the choice away from you and makes exploring on your own feel like a deviation from the norm rather than a necessity which takes the cool factor out of stumbling upon new areas away to some extent  Overall still highly recommend but if youre fine with sacrificing the quality of life changes the first game is a better purchase;36.2;1.0;0.0;61.0;14 May, 2022;967
891;Subnautica: Below Zero; The graphics creatures and and scenery in this game are absolutely amazing On top of this the game runs really well even with high graphics The only thing that I had an issue with was figuring out what to do and how to progress the story;5.1;1.0;0.0;15.0;14 May, 2022;244

893;Subnautica: Below Zero; Great game great story but no where near as scary as the first game which was a real bummer and it kinda got me a little bored of this game for a good while;16.4;1.0;0.0;26.0;13 May, 2022;160
894;Subnautica: Below Zero; If youre expecting something exactly like Subnautica then youll be disappointed Below Zero is a lot more linear and narrative driven but still a very good game Youre no longer a mute protagonist in fact you actually have a lot to say youre never alone and thats all I can really say without spoiling anything Theres still beautiful environments goofy fish base building etc  Also the Seamoth and Cyclops have been merged into one vehicle the Sea Truck Youll build the cabin early on then obtain trailers to hitch to the back as you progress Its not better than the two but its not worse Its a whole new experience which I personally enjoyed You wont feel invincible like in a Cyclops In fact you will normally feel extremely vulnerable but the amount of customization the Sea Truck has puts the Cyclops to shame;37.1;1.0;0.0;119.0;14 May, 2022;852

929;Subnautica: Below Zero; Fun game - very close experience to the first game Similar progression exploration crafting Feels like a lot less requirement to farm materials New creatures land exploration and story all keep this game feeling fresh The story builds on the first game and gives a nice alternate perspective  I do miss the submarine The seatruck is cool but I honestly never ran it with any segments other than the prawn suit docking station Never even built the land vehicle because it didnt seem necessary The prawn suit works just fine and is quite nimble on land with the grappling hook  Guidance for where to explore and find things is a little whack I got both advanced oxygen tank recipes before I ever found the mid-tier oxygen tank And got super lost towards the end when I stopped getting beacons from the game The Wiki helped solve both of those issues but it would be nice if the game was able to provide you with the information to progress or give you some way to work for the info;21.2;1.0;0.0;310.0;10 May, 2022;1001
930;Subnautica: Below Zero;In like 2017 after completing the original game with a friend we both just sat there absolutely stunned what we had just played the greatest game ever still Now back to this game after being launched logically we were ready to play this game in 6 hours after it launched i think it was a friday morning and we had no plans To sum up - the best weekend ever We finished the game in 2 days and looking back the binge was definitely not worth it i kind of ruined it Yes there are some cons too but anyhow I just cant really put into words how the game felt  I can now only fulfill my duty as a reviewer to guide others to a treasure i have found myself so go there and explore the icy world of planet 4645B;27.6;1.0;0.0;136.0;09 May, 2022;717

950;Subnautica: Below Zero;Sure the game isnt as scary or great as the first but it is not bad once you give it a try Would recommend if you did play the first Storys not bad as of 10 update and the base building has been expanded to allow for more possibilities Large room ftw;54.6;1.0;0.0;261.0;08 May, 2022;262
951;Subnautica: Below Zero;The world and design is a great improvement on the original visually But the lack of natural story telling through mystery and the lack of predatory creatures removes the threat and intrigue that was felt in the original The terrifying depths and unique areas were missing from the original for the most part Still was really fun and a natural evolution on the first game;20.3;1.0;0.0;352.0;08 May, 2022;375

961;Subnautica: Below Zero;Beautiful and a really good game so far but the amount of time that takes you to get materials is really long and boring Of course by getting those materials you discover more places and wrecks but still it takes more than half the time you actually get to play the actual story;24.5;1.0;0.0;5.0;07 May, 2022;280

964;Subnautica: Below Zero;subnautica below zero will not run whatsoever none of the fixes work ive tried everything listed in the forums and on random websites NOTHING worked the game opens up to the menu fine but the second you take off in the opening cutscene it crashes when i skip the cutscene and it puts me in the meteor field it crashes when i barely touch the mouse the closest ive gotten to actually even playing the game is by selecting creative mode with all graphics at the lowest settings AFTER having tried multiple fixes it let me step into the water for maybe 10 seconds before crashing the game will not run no matter how many of the fixes listed i try and this is the only game i have ever played to give me this problem my system info copied directly from settings maybe someone can actually help me Processor IntelR CoreTM i7-2600 CPU @ 340GHz 340 GHz Installed RAM 120 GB System type 64-bit operating system x64-based processor Edition Windows 10 Home Version 21H2 OS build 190441645;18.7;0.0;0.0;21.0;07 May, 2022;999

979;We Were Here Forever; Very fun and engaging puzzle game for 2 and a massive improvement from the previous games in the series TotalMayhem keep outdoing themselves;10.7;1.0;21.0;90.0;12 May, 2022;144
980;We Were Here Forever; Fantastic entry in the series Much longer story than the last games and better puzzles by far You can tell the developers love what theyre doing and they get better with each game Love it;9.1;1.0;13.0;174.0;11 May, 2022;194
981;We Were Here Forever; If youre looking for a fantastic two person co-op experience then look no further Grab a friend and get really angry at eachother for not being able to explain the basics of a door and weird symbols The story is an incredible step up from the previous games which are also out right fantastic and the puzzles are challenging and really interesting At the time of my review there are a few bugs like framerate stuttering and a puzzle or two that gets you just stuck but the game is good at leaving checkpoints so getting back to the same spot will be no issue at all  I whole heartedly recommend this game even at full price this game is a steal;10.7;1.0;22.0;1613.0;11 May, 2022;655
982;We Were Here Forever; We Were Here Forever is easily the best game in the series every puzzle was interesting and challenging and the difficulty would only increase each chapter  my only complaint would be the bugs and slight performance issues considering it took quite a while to make this game i do believe it shouldve been polished a bit more upon release a bit frustrating that i unlocked both achievements for both endings at the end and my save bugged out meaning i had to restart the finale/chapter as mentioned before with performance issues i experienced frame drops that would make me restart my game every once in a while 20-40 fps even with ideal settings  other then the bugs i would rate We Were Here Forever a 95/10 and would recommend playing We Were Here Together first if youve never played any of the games in the series We Were Here is a fantastic series if you are into puzzle games or even just looking for something different to play with a friend;16.3;1.0;8.0;54.0;13 May, 2022;972
984;We Were Here Forever; Dont take this review without reading this The game is fun with lots of good ridles but we had over 3 hours of gameplay needed to restart some chapters due to bugs a save buged out Black screen for the host and multiple items without pickup possibility pickaxe or pipe I can recommend this game easly but wait up some bugfixes if you dont want to waste time on reseting the game;11.0;0.0;29.0;200.0;14 May, 2022;388
985;We Were Here Forever; An incredible game that fits perfectly into the previous trilogy;11.1;1.0;27.0;1406.0;10 May, 2022;66
987;We Were Here Forever; We sat there for an hour and a half at safe puzzle in the beginning Turned out I had to click on the safe door to open it;6.0;1.0;5.0;413.0;13 May, 2022;122
988;We Were Here Forever; After my first play through I would rate this a 95/10 The game play is truly remarkable From the puzzles of varying difficulty and length to the atmospheres that help immerse me into the game each chapter that was played allowed me to enjoy the game more and more but also helped get the proverbial gears turning in my head for further puzzles  The music alone is really nice and I would love to see a soundtrack available for download   All together We Were Here Forever stands to this date my favorite puzzle game and I am excited to go through it again   The only issues I have had so far are sometimes the walkie-talkies would stop working for an entire chapter restarting would fix and in the last portion of the game there is a animation to get up ladders which was kinda buggy but other than those two small bugs smooth sailing;12.2;1.0;6.0;137.0;12 May, 2022;850
991;We Were Here Forever; Forever that such a long time;3.2;1.0;5.0;45.0;11 May, 2022;37
992;We Were Here Forever; made brain hurt  EDIT just finished game great puzzles although was super buggy at times where me and my partner had to literally reset the game to continue times textures were not loading puzzles were not letting us interact and simply not allowing us to walk forward to complete the game still worth playing definitively worth the price as it took us 11 hours to complette;10.8;1.0;18.0;23.0;10 May, 2022;381
993;We Were Here Forever; Played the beta when it was available I was only able to play 1 part of the game so now Im super excited to be playing the full game All I can say is Id highly recommend you buy this game  and previous we were here games  with a friend to have a amazing time You will not regret it a single bit Even if you havent played a lot of puzzle style games  like i did  its super well made and a lot of fun;5.2;1.0;12.0;100.0;10 May, 2022;412
994;We Were Here Forever; Its a very fun puzzle game much more to do and more immersive story from We Were Here Together If you are a big fan of a variety of puzzles from my perspective they are for the most part easier than the previous game in this series;12.1;1.0;4.0;491.0;12 May, 2022;236
995;We Were Here Forever; fantastic game absolutely loved playing it with my best friend who i played all the other we were here games with there were some issues like some frame drops and like 2 different game breaks that were resolved instantly by reloading the game  one issue as far as i can see theres almost no way to tell which person is playing what role which got aggravating because when we came back to the game the next day we had no idea which person was which character which in the end doesnt really matter but we thought it would and caused a bit of distress;8.8;1.0;4.0;100.0;12 May, 2022;557
997;We Were Here Forever; This game is a MASSIVE step-up from games 1-3 absolutely worth way more than the store price For reference finishing just chapter one took me and a friend 25 hours of playtime Try not to get spoilers and enjoy the game;6.4;1.0;6.0;103.0;10 May, 2022;224
998;We Were Here Forever; Amazing game Glad to be a part of beta tester community for this game as well Cant recommend this series enough Everyone who has a gaming buddy must try out all of the We Were Here games;14.5;1.0;6.0;57.0;10 May, 2022;192
999;We Were Here Forever; They keep one-upping themselves with every new entry and this is no exception;11.4;1.0;3.0;124.0;11 May, 2022;80
1000;We Were Here Forever; We Were Here Yo very good series as long as you like puzzle games;8.5;1.0;2.0;630.0;14 May, 2022;67
1001;We Were Here Forever; gOD tier game Ive so far have played through the whole series with a friend that also loves CO-OP games and I have introduced other friends to these games and they will forever be my favorite The puzzles in this game to me are so much more different than the other ones  The ONLY issue I found is in some areas you advance to there is a huge lag spike It doesnt last for the entire puzzle but it is definitely something to take into consideration;8.0;1.0;5.0;138.0;10 May, 2022;458
1002;We Were Here Forever; This game has a longer playtime than previous games but still feels worth your time There are more puzzles added in comparison to other entries and theyre longer  There are some bugs at release especially when you die during the puzzle and are reset some of which are visual or audio bugs Some puzzles can get extremely frustrating not because the concept is complex but just because theres a very specific answer to the puzzle that will take some trial and error to get to  But overall a really good experience even if you havent played the previous games before The same lore is used so its cool to see how it really ends Make sure you bring a buddy who isnt too hotheaded;11.3;1.0;2.0;62.0;14 May, 2022;694
1003;We Were Here Forever; its not one of its THE BEST puzzle game ive ever played its soo creative its insane and its not even easy its really really enjoyanble not only that you learn the story along the way you crack the story of the game by completing the puzzles its amazing;20.0;1.0;2.0;140.0;14 May, 2022;257
1005;We Were Here Forever; Super fun game to play with your friend Some puzzles are easier then others but the game keeps a good balance A lot of people are complaining that 1 player is doing nothing while the other does everything This is simply not true or at least very over exaggerated You always have to communicate with each other its part of the game;9.4;1.0;2.0;457.0;14 May, 2022;337
1006;We Were Here Forever; good puzzles fun glitches great if you want reason to scream at ur friends;12.8;1.0;1.0;47.0;14 May, 2022;78

1012;We Were Here Forever; No more bananas This ape only wants to break the chains that bind him;10.5;1.0;2.0;296.0;12 May, 2022;72
1013;We Were Here Forever; Beat the game in around 10 1/2 hours total Was pretty good as a whole a couple puzzles were a tad too vague but otherwise it was great I think one more zone before the finale would have also greatly benefited the game;11.1;1.0;2.0;788.0;12 May, 2022;222
1014;We Were Here Forever; Only finished first Chapter so far and well wow Massive improvement on the previous ones Not to discredit them or anything but this feels like so much more and from the looks of it youll definitely get your moneys worth for how much content there seems to be Well done;11.3;1.0;1.0;330.0;13 May, 2022;278
1015;We Were Here Forever; This is by far the best game in the entire series  it finally ties the story together has the best puzzles in the series fantastic and surprising moments  The ending Puzzles are fantastic if you like we were here and have a buddy you gotta give this a play I cannot reccomend it enough;9.7;1.0;1.0;851.0;13 May, 2022;293

1026;We Were Here Forever; As a huge fan of the previous We Were Here games Ive been waiting for We Were Here Forever for a long time And Im more than satisfied Its a perfect continuation of the previous games both puzzle- and lore-wise and still manages to surprise and introduce tons of new puzzles and content Cant wait to finish the game yet dont want it to end so I hope its long  Ive played for 2-3 hours now and encountered some bugs though Mostly non-significant but theres a huge bug that makes the in-game voicechat stop working sometimes you stop hearing the other person until you press and release the push-to-talk button again so I hope it gets fixed soon  Total Mayhem has gone a long way since the first We Were Here game and the direction is on point Keep it up;10.7;1.0;1.0;162.0;10 May, 2022;777
1027;We Were Here Forever; Best one in the series play the other 3 games first and then this one Make sure its blind playthrough for all of them make sure your friend is also playing blind;10.8;1.0;1.0;119.0;13 May, 2022;165

1032;We Were Here Forever; Amazing game so far 3 hours in and weve only completed chapter 1 out of 6 Theres so much content and its very worth the pricetag;6.4;1.0;1.0;103.0;10 May, 2022;135
1033;We Were Here Forever; epic puzzles that requires a big brain at times some puzzles are a bit underwhelming compared to the previous games but some are really quite difficult and entertaining and you get very excited once you finally figure it out recommend playing with a good friend it makes the experience much more enjoyable;4.7;1.0;1.0;67.0;13 May, 2022;312
1034;We Were Here Forever; 10/10  Built on an already great story and game design fantastic finale the series Would recommend to anyone that enjoys co-op games Although it did require some game restarts to get past some bugs but Im sure those will get patched out soon enough;10.6;1.0;1.0;64.0;11 May, 2022;256
1035;We Were Here Forever; Super fun I played it in one sitting with a friend and it was a cool experience dont play it in one sitting The story isnt the strongest so if you want to play for story you might not find it as fun The puzzles are great though I cant wait to see what else this company releases in the future~;14.2;1.0;1.0;51.0;12 May, 2022;304

1044;We Were Here Forever; Feel like a proud father having played all the games starting back in February 2017 A truly fantastic 11 hour experience which was everything I wanted it to be A must play series not just this single game that in my humble opinion is better than the 2021 GOTY It Takes Two No less than a 10/10 rating fully worth buying at any price   Every area was incredibly well thought out and produced Puzzles were as usual spectacular especially the toy box And to top it all off a perfect ending to the perfect game series;11.3;1.0;2.0;73.0;10 May, 2022;528
1045;We Were Here Forever; With each entry into this fantastic Adventure puzzle solving series the puzzles get more and more elaborate and head scratching and can make for some unforgettable friend memories A must play for anyone who has a friend who wants to deal with a lot of miscommunication mishaps and mind bending puzzles;10.3;1.0;1.0;524.0;12 May, 2022;305

1050;We Were Here Forever; <3 love love love love this  much better than It Takes Two if its hard puzzles you are after Its wayy more big brain high IQ stuff than other games of this co-op type 10/10 so far im not super far into it;6.5;1.0;5.0;147.0;10 May, 2022;209
1051;We Were Here Forever; This is a beautiful way to end the series Plenty of beautiful wonderful puzzles Each one made us think and wonder about I played at launch so of course there were a handful of bugs but I am certain many of them will be fixed soon but none of them were bad enough a quick restart wouldnt fix the issue It however feels like if I play through it again I wouldnt have as much fun as the first three games Only because both players were so close to each other for so much of the game This of course isnt a problem at all just a note Regardless whatever these creators make in the future I will happy support them;10.6;1.0;1.0;410.0;12 May, 2022;621
1053;We Were Here Forever; Ive played all 4 of the games in this series and even now Were Here Too shines the brightest Playing this one was very fun as the puzzles are relatively complex and the gameplay/NET code has seen great improvements however I find it missing the same things We Were Here Together was missing as well as new components that feel out of play or destroyed what it was I had originally desired in-game Most of the game is spent together like the 3rd one which if you enjoyed youll probably enjoy this game as well but if youre like me and you enjoy the 1st and 2nd game you may not like this title much I wont go into spoilers but this one felt very endgame-esque with the ending making me wish I hadnt wasted my money and just quit after not enjoying the 3rd game I really miss what brought to the table and it makes me very sad to see how the story/gameplay went in;8.9;0.0;2.0;125.0;13 May, 2022;889
1054;We Were Here Forever; Great co-op amazing puzzles creepy story and a tough decision bringing friends together or splitting them forever We Were Here Forever has it all All you need and all youve searched for Take your torch and find your way dont let Jester bring you astray  My friend and I were hyped for a long time but did not got disappointed at all This game continues the success of the series in an outstanding way You wont regret it;13.2;1.0;1.0;535.0;12 May, 2022;434
1055;We Were Here Forever; If this is an ending point to the series this is probably the lowest note they could have ended on Its still a good game just in my opinion the worst in the series Some of the puzzles were interesting and unique others felt extremely lacking in content and how to solve them Certain puzzles seemed very one-sided such as one person having no fun helping solve the puzzle leaving the puzzle up to your partner to solve almost by themselves Other than that some of the puzzles are buggy requiring restarts of your game and frustration all around I hope there is another in the series to redeem this one;15.1;0.0;2.0;315.0;13 May, 2022;615

1061;We Were Here Forever; The lore and backstory for We Were Here Forever is extraordinarily deep and engaging particularly in comparison to the mystery and vagueness of the last three games story wise Unlike the past three games which i also highly recommend particularly before playing this which reveal very little lore wise behind the actions of the two explorers We Were Here Forever completely changes that dynamic diving much deeper into the lore which myself and many others have very much been looking for This game and the whole We Were Here series is a must to experience with a friend 10/10;34.8;1.0;1.0;65.0;12 May, 2022;588
1062;We Were Here Forever; This game is honestly one of the best co-op experiences out there it truly tests your relationship with who you are playing with How well can you forgive your partner at the end of the day threw trials and frustration coming together is what this game is about i however dont suggest this game to any couples that have poor communication skills and even worse ability to forgive one another for the outbursts of frustration that may and will ensue But know the reward you gain is the understanding and deeper bonding you two may gain from understanding one another better and more deeply;8.1;1.0;1.0;165.0;13 May, 2022;595
1063;We Were Here Forever; The game is fun but it crashes constantly and it force us to start the puzzles all over from scratch unplayable  Edit I sended the crash reports to the developers Ill change my review to positive because I really had a lot of fun while playing regardless of the crashes hope it gets polished with time and then Ill try it again;1.1;1.0;0.0;676.0;12 May, 2022;336
1064;We Were Here Forever; Do not buy until several bug fixing patches have been released through 12 hrs so far and have experienced a bug that did not allow partner or I to progress through story a bug that threw us threw the map a bug that will not currently let me load from our checkpoint thus functionally stopping our progress and have had multiple areas that cause FPS drop / lag for no reason  Story seems great puzzles are decent but due to bugs and performance issues this is not a worth buy until patches come out;12.7;0.0;4.0;92.0;13 May, 2022;507

1082;We Were Here Forever; This game has a game breaking bug that prevents further progression at the graveyard One player is supposed to interact with locations marked on a map that the other player must describe After the first one they simply cannot be interacted with Have spoken with other players in the official discord for this game and they have also encountered this error and had to try multiple restarts to work around however it is not guaranteed to work after a restart For a puzzle game to have a bug that simply prevents progression I cant leave a good review for this game shameful because I enjoyed the prior 3 games;12.7;0.0;17.0;282.0;11 May, 2022;617

1093;We Were Here Forever; Product refunded  Bought this for myself and a friend Then we were unable to play it as it got stuck on a black screen loading the first level We tried everything deleting the appdata dir running under dx11 forwarding firewall ports changing network region disabling crossplay etc Nothing worked finally decided to give up after spending a full hour attempting to get the game to load and ask for a refund Im pretty disappointed because I was really looking forward to trying it;0.9;0.0;4.0;658.0;11 May, 2022;492
1094;We Were Here Forever; I know the developers dont want to deal with supporting Linux and thats fine - but its a disappointment that all 3 previous games worked fine under Proton and this one wont launch because it cant connect to their voice chat server under Proton  Ive never used the in-game voicechat in any of the previous three just eaiser to use Mumble/Discord/etc and it seems dumb that because theres no option to not use their server the entire game is unplayable for me  I may try it on my Windows machine later but the decision to not allow connections to the Vivox voice server to be skipped since even on Windows Ill still be using Mumble makes this a massive thumbs down for me until/unless that changes;0.2;0.0;38.0;507.0;11 May, 2022;717
1095;We Were Here Forever; please please please if you do anything listen to HazZarD0usSs review this game runs like a pile of dog **** ur stuck at a black screen not worth the buy please trust me literally bought and could NOT even load the game what so ever DO NOT BUY PLEASE DO NOT BUY;0.4;0.0;1.0;16.0;14 May, 2022;277
1097;We Were Here Forever; like many games in this genre your limited by the other players ability to problem solve and a majority of people are down right stupid i mean they make forest gump look smart the idea is great but the developers dont understand that the general group of people your gona randomly join probably dont even have a mic also dont play this with your friends unless you want to lose all respect you have for people i would quit just to reinvite my friends so i could take over on their side since it was to hard for them just to come to find out its extremly simple and i still have to walk them through it like a 2 year old i guess most people cant count and are so high their short term memory adds a whole new spin on this game -1000/10 waste of time;9.8;0.0;1.0;469.0;13 May, 2022;754

1103;We Were Here Forever; Big fan of the series and eagerly awaiting this release It was disappointing to say the least It feels incredibly clunky with similar puzzles from the previous games The camera angles and level design leave a lot to be desired Whereas the old games felt fun to explore and push through this felt unpolished and painful to move around;2.0;0.0;4.0;290.0;11 May, 2022;340
1104;We Were Here Forever; I do recommend this game Its a really good and fun puzzle game not once we had a moment we totally didnt get it and had to look up how to solve puzzles though i still dont understand the kraken puzzle Yet i absoluetly  hate this kind of endings My god is it really so hard to make some kind of secret or something to get both players to be alive in the end With no such ending i cannot give it a positive review this just purely sucks Next time i die for my friend ingame i will shoot myself irl >;10.2;0.0;3.0;188.0;11 May, 2022;517
1105;We Were Here Forever; It is nearly impossible to play this with a friend do to the puzzle game play I dont mind puzzle games and I dont mind a good challenge but this was too much If you want to play a game where you have to understand the rules of the mini games your playing then also have to navigate who your playing with If you like games that will frustrate you and your friend at the same time this game is for you;2.6;0.0;4.0;9.0;10 May, 2022;404

1112;We Were Here Forever; I really wanted to like this game I played the last 3 and they were some of the most fun i had in a puzzle game But with the frustrations of constant bugs making it impossible to move on I had to have a guide up just to make sure It was me and not the game I have a 5800x and a 3070 and i still got 13fps in a lot of settings there are parts that are unopimized and makes it nearly unplayable;10.3;0.0;0.0;391.0;14 May, 2022;398
1113;We Were Here Forever; Product received for free  The game is good bugs at least met a couple of times There are many interesting puzzles but there are also bad ones like the coffin level Please warn about spiders there are people with arachnophobia In general the game is very good I recommend it to everyone;21.6;1.0;1.0;42.0;14 May, 2022;295
1114;We Were Here Forever; Thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of this series but this one has by far been the best We Were Here Forever offers more insight into the lore behind the other games and features well-thought-out pleasantly frustrating puzzles with stunning environments and cut scenes There were a few bugs but nothing that ruined game play Highly recommended to anybody who has played the previous games;13.2;1.0;1.0;15.0;14 May, 2022;392

1125;We Were Here Forever; Easily one of the best puzzle games Ive had the pleasure of enjoying with a friend The atmosphere is unnerving and interesting and the puzzles are surprisingly varied and very creative Even though my adventuring partner and I met each new challenge with a collective groan we shouldered them together and made it through  The game briefly treating us to proximity chat however did make me wish that this was possible throughout the game as the priority system makes it difficult to banter while puzzling for fear of silencing the other;10.8;1.0;0.0;323.0;14 May, 2022;546

1133;We Were Here Forever; This is one of the best puzzle games  and without a doubt the best co-op puzzle game i have ever played it really nails the feel of the world the story and the focus on puzzle solving and communication 1 person never can see the full solution but have to communicate with the partner to solve it so the way co-op puzzleing should work The only down side is the lack of replayabillity you can play this game once and only once but that is a price im willing to pay for such good puzzles;10.2;1.0;0.0;520.0;14 May, 2022;501

1135;We Were Here Forever; I really love this game and want to recommend this game However the game-breaking bug caused me to not be able to continue to last chapter Its caused by using play without save which was the solution for another bug caused the collective progress in last chapters not saved throughout the sessions  I will update the review if there is the solution to this without playing the whole game again;12.4;0.0;0.0;305.0;14 May, 2022;402

1145;We Were Here Forever; Played all the games in this series and I love each and every one 8/10 Love it  Now some puzzles were a bit confusing and me and my friend couldnt really understand but we were able to wing it and somehow figure it out There are two things that each took a point and one of them varies from each person  The first one is the frame issues Some areas KILLED my fps to the point where it hard to move let alone enjoy Thankfully it went away after the initial load or if I didnt look in a certain direction in one area but it did ruin the experience a bit  As for the second part it was because of a phobia I wont go into details cause the area is spoilers but all I want is the option to hide them or change how they look in some way  Overall good stuff Get a friend and prepare to scream at each other over what shape is more phallic and who is forgetting to share a crucial detail;9.1;1.0;0.0;209.0;14 May, 2022;898

1151;We Were Here Forever; the scale is incredible and the puzzles present you with a lot of communication tests between you and your partner This leads to funny situations and chaos when youre frantically rushing to save your partner The story feels fresh and new compared to the other games too In the last games we knew a bit about the lore in little pieces but everything ties together in this game and the true Castle Rock secret was revealed Some cut scenes and transitions were a bit buggy but thats because this is the first time Total Mayhem has built a We Were Here game on a scale like this and with the quality that was presented id be happy to take that trade off This game is best played with a partner predetermined so you can work well together and have the most fun LFG does exist but when you join you join at the hosts progress so youll start at different places most likely each time you play I played with my best friend which i would recommend you do Buy this game you wont regret it;12.4;1.0;0.0;86.0;14 May, 2022;998

1173;We Were Here Forever; Ive always loved the series Myself and a friend were playing through as we always do and in chapter 1 the momento you both spawn in and cannot go anywhere We tried hosting the game each of us and one person would load in while the other sits at a black screen It is consistent and not making us spawn on opposite sides of the map to complete the puzzle Now we are stuck Please fix this  At this moment in time i cannot recommend this to friend due to this game breaking error;2.5;0.0;0.0;260.0;14 May, 2022;492
1174;We Were Here Forever; Im not really a review writer but I really want to support the studio for making such fun experiences through their games The riddles/puzzles are diverse even compared to the older games Some can be more challenging than others but everything is totally manageable after some time and thought I dont know how its like to play with random players maybe more fun or more exhausting but if youre playing with a friend be patient with each other because both of u will feel like bigbrains and idiotic fools at times There is no inbetween  Anyway Everything was as good as expected but for me the story telling was the most outstanding part compared to the older games We thoroughly enjoyed it and I cant wait for my bad memory to kick in so I can further test the limits of my other friends tolerance ;16.5;1.0;0.0;95.0;13 May, 2022;830
1175;We Were Here Forever; All the puzzles have been set in with intriguing concepts and the environment the puzzles are put in feel right with the location and really make each area fun to move around in and look around This game has been a big step up from the other games with its graphics and how more story-driven we are as the characters when moving around to move to different areas from how it felt back in We Were Here and We Were Here Too Big improvement  The environment I can tell has been put in with a lot of effort and only being somewhat halfway in the game so far I can say I would recommend it to a pair of friends to play for themselves knowing that the content given so far Up to chapter 6 as of writing this has felt worth its price and there is only more content to come which I look forward to doing;15.0;1.0;0.0;45.0;13 May, 2022;802

1189;We Were Here Forever; Definitely the best game of the series but still has some issues that make it seem like the developers are still struggling to figure out where they want this series to go   - A lot of puzzles rely on one person doing next to nothing while the other player has to figure everything by himself  - Out of my 9h playthrough I would say more than 1h is just walking around to go from one area to the other or to bring back an item to a specific place  - There are some really uneven areas / puzzles throughout the game Sometimes youll get puzzles that are very easy and youll storm through an area whereas some other times youll spend more than 1h in the same area  Other than these Id say its a pretty good game to play with a friend especially if you enjoyed the other games;8.9;1.0;0.0;1139.0;13 May, 2022;787
1190;We Were Here Forever; i played all the game and can say this the always a game me and my brother look forward to playing together i would recommend playing this game but the also have his downsides The Jester is the main villain of the game but it does not feel like it He doesnt pressure us to complete puzzle fast he doesnt make me feel like he really hates us and wants to get rid of us and maybe the most important of them all is that it doesnt feel like we are trying to fight him while completing the puzzles overall i would say worth the time to play tho 7/10;11.7;1.0;0.0;96.0;13 May, 2022;556

1217;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW First game of 2022 that I enjoyed Also one of the first games that brings so much memories of playing Heroes The emphases is on army building which I love since in heroes magic got to overpowered that you can literaly kill an army with 2 spells PROS Get this game its the best 30 $ you will ever spend It has new mechanics that are nice and add depth to the combat The artwork is a superbly done love labor The city mechanic is nice that you need to constantly shift things around and its not capped on every building in the main city its spread out The music is also a strong suite CONS Little aspects like UI needs to be improved but since its an alpha there is room if the Devs will listen  Overall its a long last worthy successor for Heroes 3 fans PS I tried disciple liberation but something about the game felt lifeless Here its a joy to explore the map and all the parts  Good job to the devs hope you keep improving your grear product;3.4;1.0;18.0;169.0;10 May, 2022;992
1218;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Put simply Songs of Conquest has the most beautiful pixel art Ive ever seen with fantastic animations and plenty of style and polish to go around The games core loop is very reminiscent of the Heroes of Might and Magic series and is very well done While I havent explored all that SoQ has to offer I can tell that its going to be an indie darling and when it finally reaches v10 next year there will be much to like  As it stands now its already the best homage to Heroes of Might and Magic that Ive personally ever played and Im incredibly excited to play more of it in the coming months and years Heres hoping that it sells well enough to see more and more content added to it over time and see more factions etc  Lavapotion is really on to something here You should definitely support this endeavor;3.4;1.0;19.0;604.0;10 May, 2022;844

1231;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I love Heroes of Might & Magic 3 nothing ever came close  This is the true spiritual successor to that game  Phenomenal game and very polished for an early access title  If you were a fan of Heroes of Might & Magic 3 I highly recommend this If you are a turnbased strategy or rpg game fan I highly recommend this This game is like a mix of rpg and strategy;13.1;1.0;11.0;370.0;13 May, 2022;384
1235;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I want to start by saying that I love the art design and I think this game has great potential however as it is right now I cannot recommend this game unless you are excited to support the development  The strategy is shallow -- there just arent a lot of choices given to the player The primary gameplay loop is 1 collect shiny things on the map 2 attack enemies that arent stronger than you 3 repeat I wish the locations on the map offered more interesting dilemmas and/or sidequests I wish the units had their own abilities or that there were branching upgrades to them I wish the spell system offered more interesting spells than hurt them a little or speed up this unit a little  Once you figure out a winning build theres no real reason to explore beyond it and the matches are over before you get the opportunity to really feel like its your kingdom;4.4;0.0;20.0;58.0;12 May, 2022;907
1236;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Songs of Conquest is a turn-based strategy RPG that is heavily influenced by the Heroes of Might and Magic series but is packed full of its own flavor and personality There are so many noticeable quality of life additions to the gameplay formula If you like the HoMM series then I can safely say this game is for you - even the hotkeys are similar Now if you are not a HoMM gamer then this game will be a sweet little treat that will introduce you to one of the best niche game genres Its easy to become immersed into Songs of Conquest because of the soundtrack and the beauty of the hand drawn pixel graphics I usually dont care for pixel graphics but this is quality I could see this being very fun to play with friends if you have plenty of time to chill and chat;6.6;1.0;9.0;229.0;11 May, 2022;801

1240;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW What a love letter to the long forgotten genre  This isnt a direct copy of Heroes formula This is a solid game on its own with interesting mechanics and level of depth that will glue you to your screen for a long time Youll find here an echo of the past combined with fresh concepts and new ideas which results in addictive gameplay that hooks you up for one more round and another and another  Dont skip on this one treat yourself with something actually good and support developers;9.5;1.0;10.0;954.0;13 May, 2022;520
1245;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Totally not heroes of might and magic Great art both pixels and portraits etc There is some part of the campaign already You can also do skirmishes and has a multiplayer option Seems like a very nice start to the early access  First look below ;0.9;1.0;7.0;564.0;10 May, 2022;300
1246;Songs of Conquest; Product refunded  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Good points - Magic system When each army units take a turn it generates mana of a certain color you store it and use it to cast spells -> No super spell at the beginning of the battle -> You can fling spells around if you store the mana - Army stack size cap Think kings bounty here -> Straightforward to have several heroes - City building There are certain slots of different sizes available -> different settlements for different purposes  Bad point Uninspired Artifacts hero skills and research design even spells to a certain extent Its all +10/20/30 to attack or defense stat It makes for a very bland unexciting gameplay rather than offer build options to diversify playstyle Example Basic sword and board foot soldier The shield reduces range attack damage by 50% Research options +10/20/30 defense per level of research Suggestion +10% range attack damage reduction 50 to 60% -> +10% attack of opportunity damage -> +1 movement range;1.3;0.0;16.0;123.0;13 May, 2022;1010
1248;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For everyone who hopes this game to be another Heroes of Might and Magic 3 I have good news - this actually is another Heroes of Might and Magic game Literally When I played it I had the feeling that if you gave the same task of pls make Heroes 3 to two different teams then Songs of Conquest could be the alternative pixel-art Heroes 3 we never had Until now So Is it a modern game filled with novelties and originality Is it a nostalgic really beautiful alternative Heroes 3 game we actually want  You can check my full review of the game here;4.6;1.0;13.0;88.0;10 May, 2022;607

1255;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game has been released just 2 days ago and its is in early access but the content it provides on day one is pretty impressive reminds me a lot of HoMM but with some key differences such as the cap on the amount of troops you can Buy from each type EG you can have 30 Spear-man in one stack which makes you think more carefully when deciding your army composition  All in all so far have a good experience with the game would recommend;25.1;1.0;5.0;154.0;12 May, 2022;461
1257;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW An Glorious and Fun TBS Game  Songs of Conquest is a great game because the combat feels smooth and interesting The four factions are very different and interesting since they are not your average generic fantasy factions The Spells and Essence System is easy to understand and allowed interesting builds based on the composition of your armies Finally the art animations and music are phenomenal and appealing to me since the Pixel art and their animations are easy to read and fun to look at I definitely love this game and it have potential to be one of the greats of strategy gaming Also I did not grow up with Heroes of Might and Magic so I was able to appreciate the craftsmanship and quality of Songs of Conquest greatly  This game get a YES from me Also I will try to make video content on this game by youtube Here is my youtube link;32.2;1.0;6.0;191.0;11 May, 2022;875

1262;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW So hard to give this a thumbs down but theres not enough here to justify 5 years of development by a full time team Its a straight copy of HoMM 3 with less interesting combat  Pros Art + World Map very solid Cons Combat incredibly shallow no tactical decisions magic is too weak spells are uninteresting;2.8;0.0;17.0;298.0;11 May, 2022;334

1268;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I was really looking forward for this game and so far I am not disappointed In my opinion any HOMAM fan would love this   EDIT What I like - gorgeous and colorful graphics - city building - good UI  What I dont like - battles are basically about each side rushing to other side theres not really much strategy in them - capped units max 20 archers per stack etc - spells are not really exciting to use just mehmost of the time you dont even say to yourself ah letss use a spell - unit placement before combat random tiles are picked and you can place your units there;6.0;1.0;3.0;246.0;10 May, 2022;614
1269;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Is Songs of Conquest Adventure Worthy  Yes yes it is Songs of Conquest is the perfect spiritual successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic series It has fantastic 25d pixel art in-depth turn-based strategy many RPG elements a gripping story campaign and even a built in level editor skirmish mode and multiplayer too which I have yet to spend a whole lot of time with but will be checking out soon Ive had an absolute blast playing the game thus far and cant wait for more       Ill revisit the review after more time played and perhaps a few updates;12.8;1.0;2.0;461.0;11 May, 2022;618
1270;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Song of Conquest is a exceptional turn bases trategy game that emulates games such in vein of the Heroes of Might and Magic era Before the game became  do to ubisoft adding some cool twists ideas on the use of how using spells and abilities works the usefulness of units so on and so forth this game is phenomenal there is still a good deal of things to be done for balancing theres a lot of combos and ways to run armies and wielders and more will be discussed / improved upon as the Early access continues but for now for 30$ this game gives you more than enough bang for your buck the story is well written you have interesting characters and challenging levels for the campaign setting and for multiplayer this can go up to 8 players total leading to some fun interesting and intense games if you lvoe turn based strategy games and enjoyed Heroes of Might and Magic this game is definitly worth looking into and possibly picking up;31.7;1.0;4.0;110.0;12 May, 2022;972
1272;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game reminds of Heroes of Might and Magic but in its current state it fails to be a worthy successor  I would give a neutral thumb if it was possible  good the art and sound it makes some things better than hereos  bad some ui decissions are really wicked making it more unintuitive as it has to bee the map feels cluttered with stuff but most gives just small bonuses lacks the skills and units of heroes of m&m you are tied to the factiontroops which limits the already low different units;5.8;0.0;9.0;239.0;12 May, 2022;523

1274;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Do you like heroes of might and magic 3 Do you like great looking 25D pixel art Do you like a soundtrack that absolutely slaps This is the game for you It certainly is the game for me Multiple unique factions with their own play styles upgrade-able units and tactical combat with terrain levels and spells Each faction has their own flavor and character etc This is a proper early access game where its an actual game first that more will be added to later instead of a tech demo that claims to be a game I like it;1.2;1.0;4.0;436.0;10 May, 2022;549
1275;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is a VERY good HOMM-like game with delicious graphics and sounds deep mechanics and obviously a lot of heart and soul put into it While I dont always like pixel art this is the real deal and unless you absolutely abhor it youll like too  I cant think of a real con Some small parts still need polish but this game rocks;30.6;1.0;3.0;600.0;10 May, 2022;356
1276;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW So as someone whos been playing HoMM games since heroes 2 came out in 1996 and would consider them formative childhood games I think that Songs of Conquest is actually better overall A lot of thought has gone into fixing a lot of old issues which manifests in redesigned systems like essences stack limits and so on The artstyle is quite good albeit a little pixelated at times when zoomed in but still good Music is top-notch on par or better than the tracks from the HoMM games in my opinion Playing the first campaign ended up keeping me up till 7am and I only noticed when I wondered why my head is starting to hurt so Im just gonna go ahead and call the gameplay aspect very very good;16.2;1.0;3.0;618.0;11 May, 2022;729
1277;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I never really got into HoMM even though i tried they were just a bit too old for my taste yet i knew this was a kind of game i could really enjoy Songs of Conquest makes things right by modernizing a bit the genre enough to appeal for veteran of HoMM-like or younger strategic/tactic enthousiast like me Add to that the prettiest pixel art Ive seen a surprisingly good and deep lore waiting to be develloped more as more campaigns will be added through the EA And finally a solid soundtrack that without standing out too much while you play will perfectly accompany you through your adventures I sometimes listen to it while working or reading;16.8;1.0;3.0;277.0;12 May, 2022;675
1278;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like Heroes 3 then you pretty much have to give it a shot Feels familiar yet new and it doesnt get bogged down;5.0;1.0;1.0;279.0;10 May, 2022;142
1279;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like good games play this game;7.7;1.0;12.0;310.0;10 May, 2022;85
1280;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Remember heroes 3 So did this dev This game is clearly a labor of love for the team that made it Cant recommend it enough;14.0;1.0;3.0;464.0;10 May, 2022;147
1281;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you liked HoMMM this game slaps Its still Early Access so dont expect the same content quantity but its still really good  Highly recommend;24.4;1.0;2.0;347.0;11 May, 2022;198
1282;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Have just completed map 2 of campaign 1 Am extremely impressed at this game If I didnt know it was EA I would never have guessed it Love all the tiny details animations Bard Songs and what have you  This is the successor Heroes of Might and Magic deserved A+ - would recommend again;4.5;1.0;3.0;980.0;12 May, 2022;313
1283;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The foundation is set for what could finally be the next coming of HOMM 3 Just need a random map generator and we are a go In the meantime more content needs to be added so you may want to set this aside for a bit and give the developers an opportunity to roll things out;0.7;1.0;1.0;431.0;11 May, 2022;296
1284;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game brings back all the best aspects from the Heros of Might and Magic series with a combination of the city building aspects from the latest Civilization games with the district features Songs of Conquest is easy to learn and fast paced enough to keep multiple players entertained between turns Im looking forward to future content for this game;23.6;1.0;1.0;94.0;11 May, 2022;378
1285;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW As someone who got into gaming well after classic strategy games like this died out I am loving the opportunity to play something that brings that style of game back and am enjoying it immensely;10.1;1.0;1.0;148.0;11 May, 2022;217
1286;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Full disclosure this was gifted to me by the developer but I have enjoyed it so much and I had already planned on supporting the project so I have gifted a copy of this to a friend who also enjoys these kinds of games   As a long time fan of the heroes of might and magic franchise this has been on my radar for some time In recent years the Heroes formula has grown a bit stale especially with games such as Age of Wonders 3 that really have a lot more angles but Songs of Conquest has a lot of new takes on the mechanics keeping the best and iterating on what needs updating  This is an easy recommend from me;6.1;1.0;1.0;581.0;14 May, 2022;643
1287;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW -good learning curve -multiplayers is slow rigth now -hope they make it faster in future  -campain seems hard for frogs;31.0;1.0;2.0;146.0;13 May, 2022;140

1290;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW It took 20+ years but Heroes of Might and Magic III has finally been replaced for me;0.6;1.0;1.0;877.0;11 May, 2022;107
1291;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Pretty much a modern Heroes Of Might & Magic if you liked those old games you will love this Fun combat fun as you rip around the map and explore and get loot to Already in great shape no big bugs two campaigns to play throughetc Keep adding to this and I can see this as the definitive place for people who want a heroes of Might & Magic itch This gives me that HOMM 3 feel playing this best game to replicate that game so far  Only played singleplayer and no multiplayer so cant speak on that Lots to enjoy here already though;1.6;1.0;1.0;726.0;14 May, 2022;564
1292;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Coming from decades long HOMM fanboy this is what I was looking for after Wake of Gods Only thing I would add is the option to scroll by moving my mouse to the corners of the screen;3.5;1.0;2.0;122.0;10 May, 2022;205
1293;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW As someone who played HoMM series from the 2nd game onwards in 90s and 00s Im happy to say that even from the first moments on this game succeeds to remind me the excitement and joy I felt when I played them back in the day Now if only I could create my skeleton legions;0.9;1.0;3.0;476.0;10 May, 2022;301
1294;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Despite currently lacking some QoL features and anything over 1v1 in multiplayer this one is definitely a buy HoMM feel quite cozy lovely aesthetic and artwork Its not the same but it does bring back that aura that feeling Lord willing itll only get much better with time;4.3;1.0;8.0;626.0;13 May, 2022;331
1295;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A very polished HOMM3 The systems work great the soundtrack is a bop I havent had any issues in a 4 hour run game Town building is intuitive and it removes a lot of old issues about moving your armies around and really streamlines it for some great fights I can only see this game getting better from here  My only complaint is some enemies are a bit hard to know what theyre going to do If theyre ranged / melee that kind of thing for certain races;6.2;1.0;1.0;1604.0;11 May, 2022;481
1296;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I was a huge fan of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 back in the day I had all the expansions and when I wasnt playing every single map I was making my own in the map editor When Songs of Conquest was announced at E3 2019 I was so unbelievably excited that Lavapotion was inspired by the HoMM experience and were potentially going to set things straight after the series unfortunately took more and more steps away from what made it great  I jumped into Songs of Conquest hoping to find that same spark and it absolutely delivers It surpasses everything I wanted out of the game It has enough for fans of the original HoMM games to get nostalgic about but it has just the right changes to make it its own I love building my town on the map the slow motion death animation of the final enemy unit and the unexpected variety of units  It surpasses everything I wanted and I could not be happier with this game;6.9;1.0;1.0;93.0;11 May, 2022;936
1297;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW this game is legit the dev team is really  awesome and this is their passion project really got me some heroes vibes from it and i was so glad sure its not heroes clone but hell its a damn good  game i hope for a linux port to come some day sure proton works but its not flawless option dont be disencouraged by past early access games i think this one is an exception dont forget we got what 3 games in this genreheroes age of wonders kings bounty if it doesnt succeed we may not have another chance for a heroes-like game looking for many more hours to spend on it;111.1;1.0;11.0;348.0;10 May, 2022;646
1298;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Content creator Diahborne gifted me this game because of his passion for it I need to play it more but I have to say it seems really fun I know that the game style is based off of the old Heroes Might and Magic and I had never played those games before I love just moving around the map with my hero and hoping that I make the right decision when I interact with things Its sort of similar to Total War if youve played that Also the art style is pretty cool and reminds me of Octopath Traveler These style of graphics might not be everyones preference but I like it because it makes me feel nostalgic For this style of game I think it fits Ill update this more in the future but I wanted to give the game a good review to support it  PS Team Rana;6.0;1.0;1.0;288.0;11 May, 2022;793
1299;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I like it and I dont like anything;35.5;1.0;1.0;78.0;11 May, 2022;57
1300;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I had the great joy to test this game during its alpha phase close to the launch and what can I say other than I love it I have been playing heroes 3 for years and simultaneously looked for a game that is similar but not the same And this just hits this spot If you enjoy turn based strategy with some elements of rpg give this game a try and I think you wont be disappointed;8.6;1.0;2.0;162.0;10 May, 2022;403
1301;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW It feels like 20 something years ago when I first played HOMM3 Only prettier and with some quality of life improvements Cant wait for the game to come out of early access;7.3;1.0;3.0;176.0;13 May, 2022;195
1302;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you are a true OG and still plays HoMM 2 and HoMM 3 to this day this is your HoMM 4;1.0;1.0;1.0;176.0;12 May, 2022;136
1303;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For early access this is already great content there is enough dept to not feel like playing a money grab and the art + music is just great Not that i pay too much attention to those as we are here for the Waaaaagh Add me for 1vs1 ;25.1;1.0;2.0;53.0;12 May, 2022;257
1305;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I like the game like everything I am seeing Its 2022 how the hell do you not have simultaneous turns for multiplayer Can you call the HOTA guys and get them to teach you how to code it its not that complicated;2.3;1.0;1.0;61.0;12 May, 2022;236
1306;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A great looking game with modern pixel based graphics and works surprisingly well on the Steam Deck where I am currently enjoying this;6.0;1.0;1.0;535.0;11 May, 2022;155
1307;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A great game that just needs some polishing would love to see more content in this setting please add VO for the full release;10.1;1.0;2.0;520.0;11 May, 2022;150
1308;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW From the first view looks absolutely amazing let`s see what will be changed when the game will be fully released;12.4;1.0;1.0;191.0;11 May, 2022;135
1309;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Cant stop playing a true successor to HOMM3 but prettier;8.3;1.0;1.0;388.0;11 May, 2022;82
1310;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Amazing game I played a lot in alpha before early acess but a lot of things must to be changed through Hoping for the release version Honestly the game has a huge chance to replace the legend series of HoMM because the last one either hasnt been updated for a long time or it was unplayebel crap DEVELOPERS BE STRONG and MAKE THIS GAME COMPLETE ;7.6;1.0;1.0;53.0;11 May, 2022;381
1311;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I like the game but there is one problem the text is to small and there is no way to enlarge it Im getting my money back If you put a option in to the game to change the size off the text i will buy it again hope to play soon;0.9;1.0;1.0;563.0;11 May, 2022;251
1312;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This seems like a worthy successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic games Its fun and engaging and impressive given the limited developer resources Im excited to see what this might turn into in the long term;1.4;1.0;1.0;98.0;11 May, 2022;235
1313;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is THE best game of the might and magic formula that I have played so far It fixes a lot of the flaws and the things that make such games tedious and looks gorgerous with amazing spritework  I am giving this a thumbs up to say this has promise and its already good but it needs a lot more races and features to be the true treasure it could be But this is the kind of amazing framework that you only come across very rarely;9.3;1.0;1.0;439.0;11 May, 2022;455
1314;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Im a huge Heroes fan and this game is a must buy  Graphics -The Pixelart looks like a beautiful painting and is made with so much detail -animations are great -its not everyones cup of tea   Sound -beautiful soundtrack -crisp animation sounds  Factions/Castles -4 very unique -lots of different playstyles and build orders etc -lovely heroes and units  Replayability -a dozen maps different sizes -some small campaigns -random map generator testing phase -map editor -alpha tester maps <3  Road ahead -well its early access but with dedicated developers  -there will be more maps factions etc -optimization  HAVE FUN <3;26.7;1.0;3.0;484.0;11 May, 2022;661
1315;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A great spiritual successor to HOMM III Fun to play and the art style is phenomenal Havent encountered many bugs despite it being in Early Access The only problem I encounter at times is heavy FPS drops while playing on a laptop on Low settings while hosting a match;11.5;1.0;2.0;110.0;11 May, 2022;293
1316;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW great art nice soundtrack and SFX Decent writing Simple/Complex enough management Good and fast paced combat;4.4;1.0;1.0;503.0;11 May, 2022;130

1319;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW 10/10 this is spiritual success for HoMM3;21.9;1.0;1.0;175.0;11 May, 2022;62
1320;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Only an hour or so in but Im really loving this game so far The sprite art is beautifully done the writing is great and the classic HOMM strategy feels evolved and refreshed in an interesting way  The map editor also seems incredibly powerful and Im looking forward to digging in to that more soon;1.5;1.0;1.0;665.0;11 May, 2022;326
1321;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Songs of Conquest is what I expected and more and I had high expectations The game is simply outstanding and if you loved Heroes of the Might and Magic series I can tell you this is a spiritual and rightful successor to it Score 10/10;1.5;1.0;1.0;886.0;11 May, 2022;261
1322;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW While writing this game just entered early access every aspect of it may change in the future and your experience may vastly differ from mine  Ive been playing SoC for few hours already and I want to say that so far so good It makes you feel like you play good old Heroes Of Might and Magic but in no sens it is a copy of that I think they improved upon the formula Rounds are quicker everything feels more matured there is plenty of systems and strategies to get involved with  I have a really good feeling about this game ;6.4;1.0;2.0;161.0;10 May, 2022;558
1323;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Really well made game plenty of content for beeing early access However adding multiplayer co-op/teams would be a great addition to the game Overall love it;13.0;1.0;2.0;60.0;10 May, 2022;183
1324;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I played the alpha already for quite some time and its a nice little gem of a game It still has some minor flaws but nothing which cant be easily fixed The devs are very supportive and active  With a bit balancing and some content for campaigns and the great editor I can see this getting a perfect game for everybody who loved the Homam games;8.9;1.0;1.0;173.0;10 May, 2022;368
1326;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW IT IS NOT A HEROES GAME BUT INSPIRED IN IT  The first impression was a SHOCK Since i expect Heroes of might and magic Game like Then when you understand that it is not you will like it for what it is  But this game its different its like a child between Heroes games and Battle brothers It take mechanics from both -Creature grow is daily not weekly i prefer weekly but i am okey with daily  I see the Devs are trying to improve the game i trust they will keep on it Expect new patches and fixes of balance and more ads so the game seems to have more potential in the future  What they have to IMPROVE is how you feel playing every faction to feel it more unique in PLAYSTYLE  To end the review FINAL SCORE ITS NOT Another HEROES Game /10;38.7;1.0;2.0;48.0;10 May, 2022;799
1327;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This review is based on about 4 hours of skirmish play with just one faction  As a die hard fan of HoMM3 with I guess more than 2000 hours in this game since 1999 I can have a sigh of relief because this game and the developers know what they are doing and who this game is really for Now the only thing to hope for is a long and prosperous support period for this game with lots more tweaks and fine tuning a good random map generator a couple more factions and this game is golden Guaranteed a place in the hall of fame of turn-based strategy games I am so happy and excited for the future of this game;7.8;1.0;3.0;188.0;11 May, 2022;645
1328;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Awesome game It still need some polishing and balancing but in overall game is excellent in current state Pixel art and graphics in general are beautiful and gives that old school charm Devs listen to fans feedback and are super fast in implementing good suggestions and fixing bugs so cudos to them Guys you are awesome Keep up the good work Gameplay is similar to HoMM series but its not the same game Many mechanics are different It have somewhat weaker town development than HoMM but its quite good and fun Combat is turn based as in HoMM but to me is even more fun than in HoMM I recommend this game to every turn based strategy fan especially to fans of HoMM series I apologize for shorter review but at the moment I dont have time to write proper review But I wanted to show support to the game and devs so here it is;9.8;1.0;1.0;162.0;12 May, 2022;898
1329;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Beautiful game For me who likes pixel art and HoMM series - perfect game;0.8;1.0;2.0;364.0;12 May, 2022;96
1330;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is so polished I wouldnt have believed somebody if they told me it was early access without seeing the words on the store page An incredible and worthy homage to Heroes 3;5.9;1.0;1.0;858.0;14 May, 2022;199
1333;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW My hours are way more than it shows - offline mode while in alpha/beta  ATM i would rate it 7~75/10 considering its EA - Calling it simpler version of HOMM3 is about 30% right and slightly insulting Price is a bit steep and there are still some important features in works  +Graphics +Sound FX/Music +Fast paced combat - You cant stack bazilions troops in 1 slot only downside is no wait command for every troop +City Building - Though its a bit intuitive +Wielders amount is limited by your city count - As above no stacking into infinite and beyond  ~Heavy WIP map generator ~A bit of work need to be done on tutorial ~AI needs more variety/personality  -Magic system - I like that you cant spam at start of round but rest of it doesnt feel really good -Troops re-stock every day -Bland level up talents -As many other stated no keybinds setting in options;3.1;1.0;2.0;272.0;12 May, 2022;915
1334;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Great game Balancing between units could use a bit of work some feel left behind Wait command would also be great Otherwise finally scratch the homm itch after 2 decades;14.9;1.0;1.0;298.0;11 May, 2022;194
1335;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Pixel graphics with 2d effects looks very nice Early access game feels like full game I like a lot map editor multiple different tools will help to create amazing maps Try to inspect existing community maps and you will create even better in minutes;44.4;1.0;1.0;146.0;11 May, 2022;275

1339;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The greatest successor to HoMM because only one lol  If you got bothered playing 1000+ hours of Heroes 3 you must try this out Despite some problemsAbsence of simultanious turns and RMG which i think will be resolved before full release developers did good job to evolve Heroes concept in new and exiting way;7.2;1.0;1.0;42.0;11 May, 2022;339
1340;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Amazing Pixel art meets Heroes of Might & Magic gameplay paired with a beautiful soundtrack nice animations a good and surprisingly dark storyline For an Early Access title the game seems very well polished So far I can very much recommend it;6.2;1.0;2.0;286.0;12 May, 2022;268
1341;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW After uninstalling LOL for the 12th time I needed a new game to no life This game is IT I have played everything on the steam market Bored out of my mind I fined this GEM This RPG has exactly the right amount of dopamine hits that you desire while not being too punishing 10/10 would buy again I carefully read comments on all new games and this was the one game I just bought without looking This is how I will buy all games going forward;3.2;1.0;1.0;242.0;13 May, 2022;472
1344;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fan of HoMM 1-5 and immediately fell in love with Songs of Conquest Intelligently builds upon the classics without being a simple remake but rather SoC brings a lot of fresh ideas to the table Cant believe its still early access Recommend playing the 128*128 maps cause the 64*64 feel crowded like tiny HoMM maps I also limited FPS to 40 via Nvidia Experience like I usually do to go easy on my CPU If you experience any performance issues then try that Cant wait to continue my skirmish map Barya ftw This game will even get better during further development Thank you dear devs The relatively steep price tag is perfectly fine given the quality of the game 9/10;10.6;1.0;1.0;210.0;12 May, 2022;702
1345;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The gameplay is very nice some kind of mix of heroes 3 and disciples  Couple of things that I dont like - auto zoom in super pixelated it looks horrible - Performance is horrific need to wait for a 5-8 seconds before battle start and after the end on macbook pro 2020;16.8;1.0;2.0;11.0;13 May, 2022;294

1351;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Game is hard and punishing Visuals look amazing Music could be done better but considering the budget they have for the game it is pretty awesome  Overall 8/10  So much more room for improvements very excited for whats to come;12.6;1.0;1.0;32.0;13 May, 2022;253
1352;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game has become one of my favorites to play It has a good story and the drawn cutscenes are excellent The only thing i would say that kinda gets me is that some of the fights are kinda hard Even though it tells you there extremely easy at times your entire army of like 30 knights can get dunked on by like ten of those skeleton shield units Overall though the game is addicting and i would definitely recommend it;18.0;1.0;1.0;115.0;13 May, 2022;445

1355;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Love it so far Great HoMM vibes All the good stuff from the old games with some tweaks to mix it up a little bit They really nailed the style and game play The art and music are fantastic though I do wish the characters had a few more pixels maybe but you get used to it;7.6;1.0;2.0;230.0;13 May, 2022;302

1363;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Songs of Conquest looks great Its yet to be seen whether the devs would manage to balance the game hopefully without the obligatory micromanagement of HoMM though;3.5;1.0;1.0;3510.0;11 May, 2022;190
1364;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Interesting take on the original HoMM formula Really nice pixelart and music Will keep an eye on it to see more unit skills and hopefully one day a simultaneous multiplayer;12.9;1.0;1.0;1578.0;12 May, 2022;197
1365;Songs of Conquest; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A really great turn-based strategy game that is also a sort of a spiritual successor to the older heroes of might and magic games There is a unique magic system lots of RNG and lots of replay value The graphics music and atmosphere are all top tier Highly recommend;355.4;1.0;4.0;61.0;10 May, 2022;321

1369;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Possibly the most polished Early Access game that ive ever seen in the store along with communicative devs and a proven concept with some new takes  cant wait to see what the future has in store for us;7.2;1.0;3.0;195.0;10 May, 2022;225
1370;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Im not a big fan of the HoMM serie and Im only familiar with the IVs and VIs parts which arent really liked by the HoMM community But this game is definetely the successor which worth the wait  Special thanks for pixel art style and only 27Gb size;1.2;1.0;1.0;70.0;11 May, 2022;280
1371;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Game is really neat so far but it is borderline unplayable AI is seriously rigged and really really ruins the experience Get ready to constantly be in shock at the sheer difficulty creep in the campaign and be utterly confused as the easy AI barrages you army after army as you struggle to fund any endeavour Maybe youll have a better experience with multiple AI Prepare to be targeted and have random You lose screens come up for no apparent reason ending your game without warning or response  Also the rats are seriously overpowered AI pumps out full stacks of them no issue and they hit way harder than they should  When they AI gets told to chill the F out Ill update the review to the frustrating but otherwise really cool game;7.7;0.0;7.0;178.0;13 May, 2022;769
1373;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Dont know how to say it but when playing this it brings back that one epic feeling like playing for the first time Disciples 2 and Heroes of Might and Magic 3 LOVE;3.2;1.0;3.0;437.0;10 May, 2022;190

1380;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Same ideal as Heroes Might and Magic Game play was good as it offer fast loading and respond Current state EA only had 2 campaign to offer and map editor To move the map around you need to hold down the left mouse button or WASD i suggest if they can offer option to use the mouse by moving to the edge of the screen;0.1;1.0;2.0;672.0;10 May, 2022;342
1381;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW First 6 hours of the game the first 3 chapters were fine felt fair didnt have too much trouble had fun Then I got to chapter 4 and suddenly I cant beat anything I spent another 6 hours unable to beat the first leader I tried multiple different strategies to no avail I checked to see if maybe I changed the difficulty but their is no difficulty option It either feels like Im missing something or the game is not supposed to be that hard Regardless Im done;12.8;0.0;6.0;61.0;12 May, 2022;498
1382;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW So we all know what kind of games inspired this one So my first comment is going to be that while it is very similar in a lot of ways it is also quite different Yes you explore you flag buildings you raise armies etc but you also need to pick just what buildings you want in semi-permanent choices you can raze places instead of conquering them like in Warlords and you gain mana by actions in combat rather than through some big mana pool so you cant just throw giant spells at enemies out the gate In many ways this has if not bettered the original formula then at least switched it up to a worthwhile degree  There are issues of course The game chugs a bit on larger maps after a long enough time building your towns up theres a few missing tooltips and the chances of you winning battles is not correct yet whatsoever But these are all issues I expect the devs to resolve before this leaves early access;7.3;1.0;1.0;969.0;13 May, 2022;948
1384;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I am recommending this as it is a beautiful crafted game in art direction and game-play Although it is in EA you will see the high level of polish it has If you were a fan of HoMM as me this is a must in your library;5.5;1.0;1.0;69.0;11 May, 2022;241
1385;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game has got a good startIt is not bad nor good its a Meh right now It is very shallow right now and aside from just wanting to support the development the content and game on its own does not merit the cost If your mad at your money or need a way to launder some this is a good start;5.6;1.0;1.0;335.0;13 May, 2022;313
1386;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Beautiful crisp fun to play;6.2;1.0;1.0;10.0;10 May, 2022;51
1387;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW So far this game looks like a worthy successor to the Heroes of Might and Magic series - something no other game has achieved;4.4;1.0;1.0;210.0;10 May, 2022;148

1390;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Oh nostalgia;3.8;1.0;1.0;177.0;11 May, 2022;33
1391;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Great game SoC has alot of potencial and goes very similiar with HoMM +music +atmosphere +controls & handling +tribes and all the details on city building It takes abit to get into the game even if youve played Age of Wonders or HoMM but its really fun Only point I have to criticize is the difficulty on enemies which are displayed by hovering Sometimes it says easy/very easy but the enemies are way stronger than the own army I really recommend to save before starting a battle D;6.5;1.0;1.0;72.0;10 May, 2022;518
1392;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Some minor bug issues but it is early access title so in the near future it will probably get polished  The game gives me the fix for my daily Heroes 3 dose so I would recommend it for anyone who likes that title;7.1;1.0;1.0;314.0;10 May, 2022;235
1393;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW this game needs some heavy optimization if you play a large map the game will start to lag hard when you get about half the map revealed longest wait i had was about a minute and a half after capturing an enemy large base before i could do anything also the AI is kinda stupid  other than that this game is really good;5.4;1.0;1.0;112.0;12 May, 2022;348
1396;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW In its current state I would not recommend the game  The biggest complaint I have is the AI cheating bs Was playing on the campaign human and made it to the third map Right after barely killing the undead hero two turns later a Fae one comes in and takes my town Nothing I could do to stop this I thought okay maybe its something Im not getting so decided to load up a skirmish 1v1 vs undead  Doing as best as u possibly can I wiped out the main enemy army was on par with mine kill his 2nd commander w/ army then he has a third one just as strong as the main and then the next turn I bring my second army over and it loses to his third then he resurrects his main hero with another full army and attacks my main The current bonuses the AI gets just makes the game stupid;4.4;0.0;9.0;251.0;11 May, 2022;817
1397;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Honestly I am a bit disappointed I have waited years for this to come out following development very closely I am a huge fan of HoMM AOW 3 etc These games are usually much more complex in combat and city development However SoC just doesnt add enough layers of unique fighting style to the combat The spells system is very boring and takes too much time/development to even be useful The biggest defining feature to the unique races was their color/art differences otherwise the combat plays out the same - whoever bashes the other enemy faster wins with very little play into strategy tactics City development was confusing and left a lot to be desired Multiplayer was a huge let down with the lack of Simultaneous turns in the 21st century - its just not enjoyable without that feature  Perhaps the game improves with more development I hope it does - I might give it another go But for now I will let the game sit for another year;1.8;0.0;20.0;232.0;11 May, 2022;976

1401;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW A love letter to HOMM3 which is one of my favorite games This game does bring that feeling back but the AI has a long way to go and the AI was among the best parts of HOMM3 I crushed it in a few hours and will now wait to see how it improves Seems to have good potential but not enough there yet for a recommendation If they can flesh it out and majorly improve the AI then of course Id be the first to recommend it;3.9;0.0;9.0;711.0;12 May, 2022;448
1402;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Its like playing HoMM 3 again but with a breath of fresh air Im reliving my childhood I cant wait to see where devs take this game but potential is here ground work is done amazingly big thank you to Lavapotion and to Coffee Stain Publishing;22.0;1.0;1.0;561.0;11 May, 2022;267
1403;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Since a long time I was searching for a game that allows you to simulate accurately the management of a soviet nuclear power plant in the eighties whith the addition of an accurate depiction of the burocratic side of the energy furniture in the syberian region Instead I found this gem Oh well my dream will have to wait but in the meantime I can play this amazing game;17.3;1.0;1.0;321.0;10 May, 2022;397
1405;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW What a waste of money If you play with 3 or 4 AI in skirmish all you can do is defend defend defend until all your troops perished or all your resources wasted This is what i get for watching to many SplatterCat review ;6.9;0.0;7.0;345.0;11 May, 2022;249

1410;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW this is a very tactical game From choosing what buildings to get first/or not at all to having your character being able to lead only so many troops at a time each of which are limited as well You decide your play style and what works for you;13.7;1.0;1.0;81.0;12 May, 2022;267
1411;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Long time fan of the Heroes of Might & Magic 3 series currently playing Homm3 Complete with Horn of the Abyss This game is a solid foundation on which to keep building and improving They got it down right The new combat systems the magic the music the graphics oh the graphics I love it Its still lacking a Random map generator and i hope they will add one some day Id say they must because a lot of people who still play Homm3 only plays it because the feeling of starting on an unkown map Anyway i say support it if you can and enjoy the Homm franchise these people have the heart in the right place They are picking up the slack on what the later installments of Homm Failed to do Homm3 will probably allways own the crown but give this one some time and it might just be the next best thing its allready so close;15.2;1.0;0.0;286.0;12 May, 2022;858
1413;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Right now I dont see any significant innovation on the original idea from HoMM/AoW etc Battles are faster and that is a big plus as is the simplified city building Graphics are lovely too If there were some new aspect or set of mechanics that breathed life into this old and tired genre then I could recommend But it feels more like a rehash;9.8;0.0;1.0;243.0;14 May, 2022;368

1423;Songs of Conquest; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I dont see why some one wouldnt recommend this game This is PRO level game making  Bashing a game for balance issue as it just got out into early access isnt a great critique  The art Is amazing the gameplay feels tight the amount of effort put into this is greatCant wait to see where they will take this game;1.9;1.0;4.0;874.0;13 May, 2022;344

1433;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; Product received for free  EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Incredibly impressed and a lot of fun especially for early access  Pros - Easily get 1000000+ units with no issue - RTS game mode allows you to give orders to the units and is very responsive - AI somehow seems to be quite intelligent which is impressive given the scale  Cons - Needs more maps & units but this will come in time with updates and the mod/workshop - Water mechanics are still quite buggy  Check out my gameplay here;28.3;1.0;198.0;131.0;12 May, 2022;490

1441;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW LOL holy cow this is beyond impressive And with Unity Lol I just witnessed a perfectly animated battle with 300000 units visible on the battlefield in a resolution of 5120x1440 How sick can a tech demo be and can we have a game around it please ;2.0;1.0;12.0;951.0;13 May, 2022;277
1442;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW On the plus time its very stable and I wouldnt have thought 1 million romans would lose to 10 fully auto Shermans lol  Its a great foundation to build on performance is impressive but I presume its taken this long to get stable as theres just not enough content and one thing that really annoys me is the Dev did the same with the first one which is they seem to think that key bindings in game you can change some key bindings on the launcher and especially invert camera are a feature NOT to have at go live I mean really  Really keen to see this grow as if it becomes the Garrys Mod of battle simulators and the community get behind it then it will blossom into something truly awesome In that sense modding needs to be a well oiled experience  Edited To mention input settings;1.7;0.0;42.0;178.0;12 May, 2022;818
1444;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Good game started a shrimp army created my own lore and story of the shrimp society being attacked by zombies they fought valiantly with pride and honor My shrimp army of 2400 stood strong against the Zombie plague that riddled their homelands the army held off a 100000 wave zombie horde by the end of the battle only 480 shrimps were left to repopulate the shrimp society before the next wave of zombie horde occurred 10 years later the shrimp army repopulated to a population of 24000 they had to hold off a wave of 1000000 zombies they fought hard lost many loved ones but they came out on top eradicating the zombies 13000 shrimp remained to repopulate and they lived happily ever after;10.1;1.0;3.0;144.0;14 May, 2022;723
1445;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Absolutely insane potential I can run 3 million units on high settings at 40fps Insane Graphics animations voice lines are all much better then before I can even run 6 million at 5 fps on high settings which is insane This tech just blows my mind This is essentially just a tech demo at the moment but once more units and maps are either added or modded then the sky is the limit I highly suggest checking this out even on lower end PCs as it should still run great maybe not 3 million units great but still Cant wait for future updates Ive got a 3070 and a 5800x so if you have a similar build you should get similar performance Also got it on a HDD and it loads pretty quick;1.4;1.0;3.0;73.0;13 May, 2022;714

1449;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Same as the first game only with more people on screen While that function of the game is impressive weve somehow lost some functionality from the first game Maximum team count has been HALVED from 8 to 4 weve lost some units and gained others and the ability to split teams into multiple groups is not available The RTS mode is clunky and fiddly and drops performance at least in my case Id advise waiting until the functionality from the original game has been implemented the RTS mode is fleshed out and more content is added;0.8;0.0;22.0;552.0;13 May, 2022;565
1450;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW On Day1 of Early Release the game is fun and I can see how its bones are better than the first game but its pretty much the same game currently I would suggest they add a few more base unit models before releasing the full game and not rely on mods too much The game speed should be more easily adjustable as well My final suggestion is if the placement boxes for units could somehow fill the environment space then it would be cool to make the German Soldiers for example hold out a temple building rather than trying to awkwardly place that box there and adjust everything It is the players made up scenarios that make the game fun afterall;1.9;1.0;3.0;168.0;12 May, 2022;679
1451;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Ever have those arguments with your friends about who would win 5 trillion 5-year-olds and one 6-year-old or 5 trillion 5-year-olds and two 4-year-olds the Incredible Hulk or his weight in Fire Ants 7 septillion lions or the sun a grahams number of gorillas or a googl of Master Chiefs one stick or 3 billion NAVY SEALs  Well you cant quite do it to scale like that in this game but its a damn good start I easily ran a game of 600k Spartans vs 4 million Zombies The framerate was smooth the animations were incredibly detailed and it was very interesting watching the path finding and tactics the AI would use I will say this the game as it is now is very unfinished Not in a bad way It runs just fine Theres just a lot to be desired like more units cheats campaign more more more That typical early access thing That said youre getting exactly what youre paying for Youre getting an Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator and you will see some epic battles;4.0;1.0;1.0;930.0;13 May, 2022;1002
1452;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Want Epic and great optimization This game is for you 2 Million Fighting Ducks vs John Wick  Easy Fill the map with mountains of zombies or send Chuck Norris into battle against hundreds of thousands of Spartans - one and a half million pieces and not a single frieze On the plus side 1 Optimization 2 Scale 3 Open workshop for mods 4 Battle Ducks On the downside 1 Supports only English;1.6;1.0;1.0;80.0;14 May, 2022;423
1453;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Definitely an improvement upon the first one the amount of units you can have on here is again insane x10 I can run it on High with around 2 million units On 36 FPS  It is ofc still in beta and need mod support along with a few minor issues but give em time to improve it even further and this title is definitely worth it;5.8;1.0;1.0;160.0;14 May, 2022;352
1455;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Solid game but needs work i get its small dev company but it has so much potential  1 running animations are very awkward and weird 2 voices and chants are all in the same weird voice 3 people who hold guns hold them very weirdly 4 roman soldiers legs look like the legs of a person who just regained their ability to walk and are super thin 5 random floating objects on the mountain map mid air 6 cant enter some spaces & legs phase through some floors  but this game is actually really good & the most fun ive had in ages and its super fun just looking at well over 1000000 people go at it  also it needs more troops eventually  great for early access;3.3;1.0;1.0;79.0;14 May, 2022;684

1462;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I saw this game on YouTube and couldnt stop watching the gameplay Figured why not give it a shot WHOA This is awesome Graphics are beautiful animations are great addiction is an issue but thats a really great issue when it comes to this game Also the gameplay glitches make it funny AF sometimes which Im sure will get fixed when its fully completed but for the time being seeing a tank retreat off into the hills while running away from Chuck Norris makes actual sense IRL All in all Id give this game an 8/10 in its current state and thats not me trying to find a reason to kick it down Legitimately this game could be a 10/10 when campaign unlocks and the modding community has their way and Ill be here for each update as the game grows and grows;4.7;1.0;1.0;34.0;13 May, 2022;804
1463;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Pretty much does everything better than the first one The scale has been dialed up to 11 so you can have way more characters on screen while being optimized way better than the first I could easily handle over a million on screen with graphics maxed out and no visible frame drops and I havent tried to see how far I can push it Everything just feels better Every unit isnt a copy-paste so theres a small degree of variety for some so they dont all look identical The only complaint at this point is the lack of content compared to the first but its early access Even if a full version of the game had less content than the first it just does everything so much better that it makes up for it;1.6;1.0;1.0;815.0;13 May, 2022;733
1464;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Tried 1M Spartans vs 1M Archers - Game was like I got this no problem  Ait imma see how far i can push you  So i tried 5  Million units ON EACH SIDE and even though i had low FPS the fact that the game had 10M units on ultra graphics all showing on my ultrawide monitor just blew my mind  This game just fulfilled some of my dream RTS scenarios Who doesnt wanna see 1M+ archers shoot at the same time D;2.5;1.0;1.0;208.0;12 May, 2022;443
1465;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I like what I have played so far the RTS mode is fun and the amount of units you can have is awesome my only complaint right now is that there is no workshop but I still think the game is great;0.7;1.0;1.0;335.0;12 May, 2022;216
1466;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW As of right now The game is worse than the original less content and functionality Claiming to have accomplished more than the predecessor is baloney with with a RTX 2060 I can barely get a decent framerate with 10k units compared to the original that started to lag at 100k The only Improvement would be the god powers and maps but even thats a stretch the god powers arent even that great The ability to take control of single units is poor the rts mode is poorly designed and the custom units are less customizable If you want to support the developers buy the original and wait for this game to be updated it seems like the road ahead for the game is great but as of right now its worth about 50 cents on a good day This game was not ready for an early access release;4.2;0.0;11.0;194.0;13 May, 2022;811
1467;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I was going to have an early night I was And yet here I am at four am watching a tidal wave of Chuck Norrises murder four hundred thousand ducks with their brawny fists I sip my whisky and wonder briefly about my future How will I perform at my new job Is moving in with my partner the right decision Have I saved enough money I quickly put these thoughts to one side and take another sip of the whisky I have far more pressing concerns this morning Who would prevail in a fight between five Sherman tanks and a million shrimps These are important questions and Im just the man to answer them;0.8;1.0;2.0;189.0;13 May, 2022;629

1471;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The scale of units and maps are insane sandbox This has been fun the blood is pretty awesome and the bodies dont vanish which is nice Mounds of zombie corpses at the ends of bridges where they run into hails of arrows from archers  Insane amount of units can be deployed like 1 000 000 zombies  Excited to see how this game progresses  ** Suggestion ** The game could do with a minimap in the UI as the maps are gigantic;6.7;1.0;2.0;166.0;14 May, 2022;450
1472;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Did I just render multi-millions of ACTIVE units on my ultrawide screen ABOVE 60FPS Like they werent stationary let that sink in  I believe in this development Even Alpha 01 was fun I am excited about the modding support and then we will see impressive scale battles on Youtube Peter Jackson will be jealous Lets go  Im on my secondary setup cant wait to try on 3090 RTX 3070 Ryzen 5 3600;3.6;1.0;1.0;914.0;14 May, 2022;429

1490;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Not sure why this game is getting good reviews There seems to be no attempt at actually simulating actual combat power which kind of makes the whole thing pointless The first thing I did in game was pit 50 WWII assault troops vs 100000 spartan warriors at a distance of about a quarter mile The 50 WWII troops got NO kills and were unceremoniously wiped out without landing a shot Obviously not remotely realistic  Next I pitted 50 Sherman tanks against the same 100000 Spartans and the tanks got wiped out quickly Granted this time I actually managed to kill some spartans but lets be real spartans are going to absolutely nothing to a Sherman  This game seems to be a spectacle simulator not a battle simulator;0.1;0.0;21.0;316.0;13 May, 2022;749
1491;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW for the amount of time i have played this game i have loved it but i have noticed a few bugs/changes that should be changed  1zombies climb up some of the walls when troops are on them have not tried with other troops 2we should be able to use more then 18 armys 3camera is to slow when moving since the maps are so big 4we cant map out where units go like the original kinda miss it 5 really nothing else i have noticed there are a lot more things like mods and more units and maps but since this is a alpha release i do understand but overall just a really good game i loved the original this is just a huge improvement over it and for such a small studio they have done an amazing job;6.4;1.0;2.0;45.0;13 May, 2022;718
1492;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW In its current state yes it can handle millions of units and thats epic But same issue as the last game lack of units like BIG TIME lack of units I will indeed give it a thumbs up if it gets to the point of 100+ units but if u gonna make a game completely about units and battles make a lot of them so a lot of battles can happen Will update this if the issue is resolved but aside from that amazing game and worth the wait lack of content is just terrible tho Still got high hopes and have faith in the devs;0.6;0.0;4.0;148.0;14 May, 2022;550

1494;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW What a great and STABLE experience It has come a long way since the og UEBS i played with ca 4 million units and there was NO performance issue at all granted i got a high end pc -5800x3d Rtx 3080 ti 16 GB Ram 3200Mhz and its installed on a fast SSD But it will surely run very good on lower spec PC`s aswell  However atm there is a lack of content for  More Units More Maps More and better optimized god Powers and of course Workshop content surely there will be a lot of stuff in a couple of weeks haha  for a early access game it shows a lot of potential lets hope it gets realised;3.7;1.0;2.0;229.0;13 May, 2022;620

1551;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW As someone who never had problems running millions of units in UEBS I this game offers nothing new Its a copy paste of EUBS I with no new features or any changes where it counts The thing I was excited most for was hopefully a better UI and better way to setup troops but instead were left with the same horribly clunky UI moving blocks of units around resizing them with numerical values and assigning them with drop down menus Anyone who could run UEBS I who says different is drinking copium Just play UEBS I if you already have it and can run it;0.4;0.0;6.0;164.0;12 May, 2022;578
1552;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I was expected a lot more content the maps get boring fast and are worse maps then from the first game I suggest sticking to UEBS1 for now do not buy this game until it has more content then UEBS1 and is better in general I am disappointed and was very excited;5.7;0.0;4.0;97.0;13 May, 2022;286

1561;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is meant to run millions of units not completely self destruct on 5 million and crash my entire  computer I literally can run numerous games such as GTA 5 with mods and it runs extremly smooth yet this cluster of a game cant handle what it was literally advertised as What the  Omw to refund this  Im literally going to go to a public swimming pool and take severe weaponry i had stashed in there and shove it down a random persons throat to try and get access to the military codes and  obliterate this game studio;0.4;0.0;0.0;54.0;13 May, 2022;583
1562;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun simulator with *massive* battles AI is definitely improved over the original UEBS1 And between possessing units and RTS-Mode you can always feel apart of the battle  200k zombies pour into a city--64 Nikola Teslas pump lightning down the alleyways like Darth Sidious Eventually rooftops are all that poke out of the body-littered-ground Nikola Tesla applies their combined-intelligence and navigate the body-hills together using rooftops to their advantage With some losses they manage to conquer the horde atop the mountain of corpses rejoice  Im hoping to see - More units and customizations such as unit speed - Steam Workshop hopefully with custom maps - Groups army-variable - divides armys units into different spawn areas - Game-speed slider from the original - Elevation of camera with spacebar - More God powers the current ones feel all too weak;1.2;1.0;0.0;372.0;14 May, 2022;909

1564;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fun game Impressive tech Not much content yet and the basic mechanic wont give you hours of gameplay but again just a really impressive battle simulator It is what they say nothing more nothing less Ill most likely be playing it once in a while when I randomnly think of matchups or chatting with friends online  I hope they keep working on their engine I could definitely see it be licensed to some RTS games like the Total War series;1.1;1.0;0.0;70.0;14 May, 2022;468
1565;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Very impressive so far but has a long way to go to be an actual game As of now it has very few troops only a few maps and not many features With 16gb ram an i4 8400 and a rtx 2060 i could have around 700k troops and stay around a stable 40 FPS;2.9;1.0;0.0;96.0;14 May, 2022;270

1573;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Same old same old UEBS  Pros they smoothed out massive numbers so even potatoes can run massive numbers in the battlefield new graphics new units  Cons they removed the move speed slider for custom units no doubt they will add this eventually no vsync of fps cap / slider menu/char creator ignores AMD Chill / external fps cap no workshop yet;3.1;1.0;0.0;207.0;14 May, 2022;373
1574;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I spent about 2 hours watching 25 John Wicks take on an army of one million zombies They killed so many that the amount of blood they generated caused a local dam to burst its banks and send a cascade of water down a dusty desert town before creating a crimson lake outside the pyramids where several other zombies drowned I honestly cant think of another game where this is remotely possible The only downside to these massive battles is that oftentimes they dont end usually some units get stuck and cant move or else the pathfinding gets messed up and they all get stuck in the same spot and become unreachable But I suppose in this case its the journey thats important  Note I havent touched the campaign yet just the sandbox;7.1;1.0;0.0;613.0;14 May, 2022;766
1575;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is early access That needs to be known up front as the UI and controlling elements are very unpolished which is to be expected in EA It is a fun game andruns great but dont come looking for a fully fleshed out game just yet;6.2;1.0;0.0;29.0;14 May, 2022;259

1582;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is uebs 1 but with bigger battles Keeping in mind that this game is early access I think for 20 dollars this game is worth Especially once workshop is added and some new maps or units hopefully I already wasted 4 hours watching thousands of men falling off a cliff because the army was too big 10/10 would buy again;4.3;1.0;0.0;43.0;14 May, 2022;351
1584;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you liked the first game then this one is just the same but better It is much less laggy and has some new units and maps However at the time of review there are some things that have not been added yet but i hope they will be in the future - The old maps - More units - Workshop;4.0;1.0;1.0;144.0;14 May, 2022;306

1595;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The game is very good & has much more possibilities then the original although there isnt much content at the moment because its in alpha you are able to basically host battles of millions create blood lakes large body piles and do all of this on a low-end computer It is worth the 17$ right now in my opinion but you should probably wait a little until they release more content if youre expecting a bunch of units & other things to play with  Its basically UEBS 1 but everything is completely better even the graphics although you might be thinking they couldve just added this all to the first game It really isnt like that considering how the game deals with large numbers of units is now completely different and they also added other things like fluid physics etc;13.3;1.0;0.0;64.0;14 May, 2022;809

1613;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The core feature works exactly as advertised You can simulate a battle of 1 million vs 1 million and it just works The maps are pretty cool too There are obvious bugs but nothing gamebreaking The worst is RTS sometimes not selecting a troop but this game isnt really about RTS  Overall its a fun time If moneys tight stick with UEBS 1 as it has way more features But if youve got a few dollars to spare and you only care about the core gameplay this is more performant prettier and just feels a bit better;7.4;1.0;0.0;20.0;14 May, 2022;548
1614;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This is a good game I like it I bought it the day it came out as I have been waiting for this game for over a year There is a pretty limited selection of units but the framerate is much more stable than it was in the last game I had 500000 units on screen and still was getting 60FPS Im impressed;1.2;1.0;0.0;53.0;14 May, 2022;327
1615;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW HEAVILY RECOMMEND This game was amazing my pc is mid range but i could still have around 500000 units on the map without problem right now its still fairly new but they plan to add tons more content this game was so fun and was way better than the last one since i never faced crashing or lag spikes The loading only takes seconds most of the timedepends on the units All around awesome game would buy for $30 if it was that price;2.2;1.0;0.0;43.0;14 May, 2022;463

1623;Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator 2; EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I have been waiting for this game for well over a year and now that its out I can only describe it as one thing absolutely impressive in every aspect of the word I used to think that the first game was incredible and while it may have its memories and nostalgia but even in this games only second day of release I am blown away at how smoothly it operates into the millions of characters on screen at once yes there are some minor things that I would like to see improved or patched in the future ragdolls flying 100ft in the air when you shoot a tank at them base camera flying speed seems a little slow not a huge variety of characters to select from no fast forward option etc but still madly impressive nevertheless this is an absolute beast of a game I cant wait to see what the developers have in store for it great job;3.1;1.0;0.0;48.0;14 May, 2022;866

1641;Rust; Not even sure how to review or rate this game this Rust game is so Rusty Crusty Dusty and Musty But then again i cant help but say that it still is better than Grim Dawn Its almost funny how this trash game can be good looking when comparing it against Grim Dawn;116.2;1.0;3.0;196.0;11 May, 2022;276
1644;Rust;Its like coccaine once you get hooked your addicted and waste all day every day just grinding endlessly just for you to be betrayed by a team mate or be raided by some toxic kids causing you to cry yourself to sleep that night then delete the game in a fit of rage only to play it more in a day or two its a loop of wasting all your time getting a little dopimine then loosing it all and wanting to die untill you take another hit its literally a hard drug its not bad but if you are debating getting this PLEASE DEAR GOD DONT DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE its a deep and painful rabbit hole thats hard to break free from so all in all 7/10 game;130.8;0.0;3.0;74.0;09 May, 2022;654
1645;Rust; Very intense and action packed MUST have a high mental capacity your sanity is constantly being tested Its a good game once you get the hang of things though the whole process can be very time consuming I would rate the in game community a 65 out of 10 it is possible to find a a non toxic person but the ratio of that and encountering a toxic one heavily favors the toxic side Game is a 83 out of 10 overall;436.5;1.0;2.0;71.0;10 May, 2022;419
1646;Rust; This game is nothing like Ive ever played I wake up for this 9-5 job that Ive subjected myself to its terrible but I cant bring myself to let it go Like Elsa from frozen Ive been playing for over 20 hours and I havent been able to walk around let alone collect resources for a base before some twink with a bow shows up behind me like that teleports behind you meme and adds an extra hole in my chrome dome for him to skull  me with My God I cant stop playing this game for the rush of dopeamean that it gives me when I murder a naked for no reason while he unexpectedly gathers resources for his own base soon to be my new crib because he was too focused collecting stone for me he just didnt know it was mine yet I would play this game for another 40 hours before installing cheats or hiring some wack 40-year-old to do everything for me so i can collet my loot form you soon to be demolished base 10/10 would buy again;37.7;1.0;2.0;31.0;11 May, 2022;950

1974;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; Product received for free  A solid professional e-sports choice As a rookie 16 player this was a welcome surprise The weapons handle extremely well The best experience for me was learning from the pros and getting better The bullet spray is fun to learn and practice Great matchmaking experience Death-matches and 5v5s are equally fun to play Although it would need some time to rank up and/or buy Prime Status Upgrade to separate yourself from the cheaters There are many other game modes but I only care about becoming better at 5v5 matches My favorite weapons are M4A4 MP7 MP9 Five-SeveN P250 and of course AWP  Other than that I am not a fan of its art characters and environment It focuses on being realistic and looks bland and uninteresting especially the terrorist team They could have upped the art direction and could have taken notes from productions like Mad Max the movie The Book of Eli etc while maintaining the visibility required for fair play;319.4;1.0;1.0;85.0;11 May, 2022;985
